Here are some model-based practical questions for practicing HTML and JavaScript. These exercises will help you strengthen your understanding of both languages:

1. Create a simple calculator
HTML Task: Design a calculator with buttons for digits (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /), and an equal sign.
JavaScript Task: Write the logic to handle the input and perform calculations.

2. Create a dynamic dropdown menu
HTML Task: Create a dropdown menu with options for selecting different countries.
JavaScript Task: Based on the selected country, display its capital in a <p> tag.


3. Form Validation
HTML Task: Create a form with fields: Name, Email, Password, and Confirm Password.
JavaScript Task: Validate the form so that:
Name field should not be empty.
Email should be in a proper format.
Password and Confirm Password must match.
Display appropriate error messages.


4. To-Do List Application
HTML Task: Design a basic to-do list interface with an input box and an "Add Task" button.
JavaScript Task: Write code to:
Add tasks to a list when the user clicks the button.
Remove tasks when the user clicks a "Remove" button next to each task.



5. Image Slider/Carousel
HTML Task: Create a basic image slider with "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
JavaScript Task: Implement the logic to switch between images when the buttons are clicked.



6. Quiz Application
HTML Task: Create a multiple-choice quiz with 3-4 questions and radio button options.
JavaScript Task: Write the logic to calculate and display the result after submission.



7. Stopwatch
HTML Task: Create a simple interface for a stopwatch with Start, Stop, and Reset buttons.
JavaScript Task: Implement the functionality to start, stop, and reset the timer.



8. Tip Calculator
HTML Task: Create a form with fields for the bill amount and tip percentage.
JavaScript Task: Calculate and display the total amount (bill + tip) when the user inputs the values.


9. Dynamic Table Creation
HTML Task: Design an interface where the user can input the number of rows and columns.
JavaScript Task: Dynamically create a table based on the user's input.



10. Palindrome Checker
HTML Task: Create an input box for the user to enter a word.
JavaScript Task: Check if the entered word is a palindrome and display the result.



11. Character Counter
HTML Task: Create a textarea input for writing text.
JavaScript Task: Display the number of characters entered in the textarea, 
updating dynamically as the user types.



12. Weather App (Using Dummy Data)
HTML Task: Create a form for entering a city name.
JavaScript Task: Use dummy weather data (e.g., an array of objects) 
to display the weather information of the city entered by the user.


13. Random Quote Generator
HTML Task: Create a section to display a random quote and a button to generate a new one.
JavaScript Task: Use an array of quotes and display one randomly when the button is clicked.


14. Interactive Multiplication Table
HTML Task: Allow the user to enter a number and display its multiplication table 
(similar to the example you worked on earlier).
JavaScript Task: Add more interactivity, such as allowing users to select the range of numbers
 (e.g., 1-20) for the multiplication table.



15. Color Picker
HTML Task: Create an input for selecting a color using an <input type="color"> field.
JavaScript Task: When the user picks a color, dynamically
 change the background color of a div to match the selected color.
