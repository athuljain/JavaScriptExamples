What is a Function in JavaScript?

    A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. 
    Functions allow you to write clean, modular, and reusable code.

Advantages of Using Functions

    Code Reusability: Write once, use multiple times.
    Modularity: Breaks a program into smaller, manageable pieces.
    Improved Readability: Makes the code easier to understand and debug.
    Reduces Redundancy: Avoids repetition of code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        function functionName(parameters) {
            // Code to be executed
            return value; // Optional
        }

Named Functions: A function with a specific name.

Anonymous Functions: Functions without a name, often used as expressions or callbacks.

Arrow Functions: A concise syntax for writing functions.

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE): 
Functions that execute as soon as they are defined.







Named Functions
    A function with a specific name, typically used for reusable tasks.


        function greet(name) {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
        }
        console.log(greet("John")); // Output: Hello, John!


Anonymous Functions
    Functions without a name, often assigned to variables or used as callbacks.

        const greet = function(name) {
        return `Hi, ${name}!`;
        };
        console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hi, Alice!


Arrow Functions

        const greet = (name) => `Hey, ${name}!`;
        console.log(greet("Bob")); // Output: Hey, Bob!


Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

    Functions that execute as soon as they are defined, often used to create a private scope.

            (function() {
            console.log("This IIFE runs immediately!");
            })(); 
            // Output: This IIFE runs immediately!


 JavaScript has several other types of functions, each designed for specific use cases.
