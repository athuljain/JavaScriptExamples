If else conditionals

    The if...else statement in JavaScript is used to execute a block of code based on a 
    specified condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the if block runs. 
    Otherwise, the code inside the else block executes.

    
    //////   syntax ///////
    
        if (condition) {
        // Code to execute if condition is true
        } else {
            // Code to execute if condition is false
        }



                let age = 18;

                if (age >= 18) {
                    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
                }else{
                    console.log("You are not eligible to vote."); 
                }

Practice Example:
Write a program to determine if a person is a child, teenager, or adult based on their age.

Nested if:
    A nested if statement is an if statement placed inside another if statement. 
    It allows you to evaluate multiple conditions in a hierarchical structure.


            if (condition1) {
            if (condition2) {
                // Code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are true
            } else {
                // Code to execute if condition1 is true but condition2 is false
            }
        }



if...else Ladder:
    An if...else ladder consists of multiple if and else if statements in a sequence. 
    It is used to test several conditions one after another.


            if (condition1) {
                    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
                } else if (condition2) {
                    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
                } else if (condition3) {
                    // Code to execute if condition3 is true
                } else {
                    // Code to execute if none of the conditions are true
                }

switch Statement

    The switch statement in JavaScript is used to evaluate an expression against 
    multiple possible cases.


        switch (expression) {
            case value1:
                // Code to execute if expression === value1
                break;
            case value2:
                // Code to execute if expression === value2
                break;
            default:
                // Code to execute if no case matches
        }

Ternary Operator
    The ternary operator is a shorthand for if...else statements. 
    It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether 
    the condition is true or false.

        condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
        



Check if a number is even or odd?
Assign a grade based on marks?

Practical Questions for Conditional Operators
Basic Comparison:

Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional (if, else if, else) statements.
Input: 5, Output: Positive
Input: -3, Output: Negative

Ternary Operator:

Use the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd.
Input: 4, Output: Even
Input: 7, Output: Odd

Logical Operators:

Create a program to check if a user is eligible to vote. The conditions are:
Age must be greater than or equal to 18.
Citizenship must be true.
Input: { age: 20, citizen: true }, Output: Eligible
Input: { age: 15, citizen: true }, Output: Not Eligible


Comparison of Two Numbers:

Write a program to find the largest of two numbers.
Input: 12, 8, Output: 12 is larger



Grade Evaluation:

Write a program to determine a student's grade based on their score using conditional operators:
Score >= 90: Grade A
Score >= 75: Grade B
Score >= 50: Grade C
Score < 50: Fail



Nested Conditions:

Create a program to check if a given year is a leap year:
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.
Input: 2000, Output: Leap Year
Input: 1900, Output: Not a Leap Year



Checking Range:

Write a program to check if a number lies between 10 and 50 (inclusive) using logical operators.
Input: 25, Output: Number is within range
Input: 9, Output: Number is out of range


Multiple Conditions:

Write a program to check if a person is eligible for a discount:
Age less than 12 or greater than 60 gets a discount.
Input: { age: 8 }, Output: Eligible for discount
Input: { age: 35 }, Output: Not eligible


Ternary with Multiple Conditions:

Use a nested ternary operator to classify a number as "Positive", "Negative", or "Zero".
Input: 10, Output: Positive
Input: -5, Output: Negative


String Comparison:

Write a program to check if a username is valid:
The username must be "admin" or "user".
Input: "admin", Output: Valid

If both are correct, output Login Successful.
Otherwise, output Invalid Credentials.


Temperature Checker:

temp < 15: Cold

// Q&a



What is the purpose of if...else statements in JavaScript?
Answer:

The if...else statement allows you to execute certain code only if a condition is true, 
and a different block of code if the condition is false. It helps control the flow of the 
program based on dynamic conditions.


What is a nested if statement? Give an example.

Answer:
A nested if statement is an if statement inside another if. 
It is used to check multiple levels of conditions.

eg:

let age = 25;
if (age > 18) {
    if (age < 60) {
        console.log("You are an adult.");
    }
}



What is an if...else ladder and when is it used?

Answer:
An if...else ladder allows testing multiple conditions one after the other. 
It is used when there are multiple possibilities to check.

eg:

let score = 75;

if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("Grade A");
} else if (score >= 75) {
    console.log("Grade B");
} else if (score >= 50) {
    console.log("Grade C");
} else {
    console.log("Failed");
}


What is a switch statement and how does it differ from if...else ladder?
Answer:

A switch statement checks the value of an expression and executes code based on matching case values.
It is generally used when testing one variable against multiple possible constant values, 
making the code more readable than a long if...else ladder.


What happens if you forget the break statement in a switch case?

Answer:
If you forget to include break, the program will execute the matched case and then 
continue executing the remaining cases ("fall-through behavior") until it reaches 
a break or the end of the switch.


What is the ternary operator and why is it useful?
Answer:
The ternary operator is a shorthand way to write an if...else statement. 
It makes the code more concise.

syntax:

condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;

eg:

let age = 20;
let message = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(message);

let numb=1999
let msg=(numb%2 ==0)? "this is even" :"this is odd number"
