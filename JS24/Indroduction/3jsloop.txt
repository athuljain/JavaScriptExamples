JavaScript Loops
    Loops in JavaScript are used to execute a block of code repeatedly
    until a specified condition is met. They help perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

Types of Loops in JavaScript
      -  for Loop
      -  while Loop
      -  do...while Loop
      -  for...of Loop (for iterables like arrays)
      -  for...in Loop (for object properties)



for loop 

        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
            // Code to execute
        }


while Loop
Used when the number of iterations is not fixed and depends on a condition.

        while (condition) {
            // Code to execute
        }



do...while Loop
Similar to the while loop but executes the code block at least once, 
even if the condition is false.


        do {
            // Code to execute
        } while (condition);
