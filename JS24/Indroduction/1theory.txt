What are Variables?
        In JavaScript, variables are used to store data. 
        They are an essential part of any programming language, 
        as they allow you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your programs.

        There are a few different ways to declare variables in JavaScript, 
        each with its own syntax and rules.

            To declare a variable in JavaScript, 
            you use the "var" keyword followed by the name of the variable.

                var x;
            
            This declares a variable called "x" but does not assign any value to it. 
            You can also assign a value to a variable when you declare it

                var x=10

            In JavaScript, you can also use the "let" and "const" keywords to declare variables.
            The "let" keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned later, 
            while the "const" keyword is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned.

                let y = 20;
                const z = 30;
