What is Programming?
        Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. 
        These instructions are written in a language that the computer can understand, 
        known as a programming language.

Why do we need programming?
        -   To solve problems efficiently using computers.
        -   To automate repetitive tasks.
        -   To create applications, websites, games, and more.

What is JavaScript?
        JavaScript is a lightweight, OOP language.
        It is a scripting language for web pages.
        It is used to add interactivity and dynamic effects to web pages.
        “.js” is the extension.
        Nowadays used in server-side development.
        JS Frontend Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.
        JS Backend Frameworks: Express, Node.

Do we need to install Javascript?
        NO. 
        JavaScript is present everywhere in browsers, on your phone, etc.

What are Variables?
        In JavaScript, variables are used to store data. 
        They are an essential part of any programming language, 
        as they allow you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your programs.

        There are a few different ways to declare variables in JavaScript, 
        each with its own syntax and rules.

            To declare a variable in JavaScript, 
            you use the "var" keyword followed by the name of the variable.

                var x;

                    * var:-
                        Used in earlier versions of JavaScript.
                        Function-scoped or globally-scoped.
                        Can be re-declared and updated.

            
            This declares a variable called "x" but does not assign any value to it. 
            You can also assign a value to a variable when you declare it

                var x=10



            In JavaScript, you can also use the "let" and "const" keywords to declare variables.
            The "let" keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned later, 
            while the "const" keyword is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned.

                let y = 20;
                const z = 30;


                        * let:-
                            Introduced in ES6.
                            Block-scoped.
                            Can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.

                        * const:-
                            Introduced in ES6.
                            Block-scoped.
                            Cannot be updated or re-declared. Must be initialized during declaration.


        let variableName = value; // Declaring a variable using `let`
        const constantName = value; // Declaring a constant using `const`
        var oldVariable = value; // Declaring a variable using `var`



    Use const for values that won't change.
    Use let for values that will change.
    Avoid using var in modern code—it has unpredictable scoping.

Data Types
    In JavaScript, there are several data types that you can use to store different types of data. Some common data types include:

        Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)
        Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')
        Booleans (e.g. true, false)
        Arrays (e.g. [1, 2, 3])
        Objects (e.g. { name: "John", age: 30 })



Data types in JavaScript represent the type of data that can be stored and manipulated 
within a program. JavaScript has two categories of data types: 
Primitive and Non-Primitive (Reference).

    Primitives are the simplest and most basic data types in JavaScript. 

        Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)
        Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')
        Booleans (e.g. true, false)
        Null (a special value that represents an absence of value)
        Undefined (a special value that represents an uninitialized variable)
        Primitives are immutable, which means that once they are created, they cannot be changed.
           
            let x = 10;
            x = 20; // x is now 20

    
    Non Primitive (Object) are more complex data types in JavaScript and are 
    used to represent real-world objects or abstract concepts. 
    They are composed of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values 
    can be any data type (including primitives and other objects).
    Objects are mutable, which means that they can be changed after they are created.

Operators and Expressions
    Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform specific operations 
    on one or more operands (values or variables). For example, 
    the addition operator (+) adds two operands together and 
    the assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
    There are several types of operators in JavaScript, including:

        Arithmetic operators (e.g. +, -, *, /, %)
        Comparison operators (e.g. >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
        Logical operators (e.g. &&, ||, !)
        Assignment operators (e.g. =, +=, -=, *=, /=)
        Conditional (ternary) operator (e.g. ?:)
