**I. HTML Basics & Syntax (1-20)**

1.  **Q: What is HTML?**
    **A:** HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the Web. It describes the structure of a web page semantically.

2.  **Q: What are HTML elements?**
    **A:** HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are represented by tags and usually consist of a start tag, content, and an end tag (e.g., `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`). Some elements are "empty" or "void" and don't have an end tag (e.g., `<img>`, `<br>`).

3.  **Q: What are HTML tags?**
    **A:** HTML tags are keywords (element names) surrounded by angle brackets (`< >`). They are used to mark up the start and end of an HTML element. For example, `<p>` is a start tag and `</p>` is an end tag.

4.  **Q: What are HTML attributes?**
    **A:** HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always specified in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs like `name="value"`. Example: `<a href="https://example.com">Link</a>` (`href` is an attribute).

5.  **Q: What is the basic structure of an HTML document?**
    **A:**
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Content visible to users goes here -->
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

6.  **Q: What is the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration? Why is it important?**
    **A:** `<!DOCTYPE html>` is a declaration that tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document. It ensures the browser renders the page in "standards mode" (as opposed to "quirks mode"), which leads to more consistent rendering across browsers. It must be the very first thing in your HTML document.

7.  **Q: What is the purpose of the `<head>` element?**
    **A:** The `<head>` element is a container for metadata (data about the HTML document). It is not displayed in the browser window. It can include the document's title (`<title>`), character set (`<meta charset="UTF-8">`), links to CSS files (`<link>`), scripts (`<script>`), and other meta information.

8.  **Q: What is the purpose of the `<body>` element?**
    **A:** The `<body>` element defines the document's body. It contains all the visible content of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

9.  **Q: What are comments in HTML? How do you write them?**
    **A:** Comments are notes or explanations added to the HTML code that are ignored by the browser (not displayed on the page). They are useful for developers to understand the code.
    Syntax: `<!-- This is an HTML comment -->`

10. **Q: What is the difference between an HTML element and an HTML tag?**
    **A:** An HTML *tag* is the markup syntax used to define an element, like `<p>` or `</p>`. An HTML *element* is the combination of the start tag, the content, and the end tag (or just the self-closing tag for void elements). For example, `<p>Hello</p>` is an element.

11. **Q: What are void (or empty) elements in HTML? Give examples.**
    **A:** Void elements are HTML elements that do not have any content and do not require a closing tag. They are self-closing.
    Examples: `<br>` (line break), `<img>` (image), `<hr>` (horizontal rule), `<input>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`. In XHTML, they were written as `<br />`. In HTML5, the trailing slash is optional.

12. **Q: Is HTML case-sensitive?**
    **A:** HTML tag names and attribute names are case-insensitive (e.g., `<P>` is the same as `<p>`). However, attribute *values* can be case-sensitive (e.g., for `id` and `class` attributes, or file paths in `src` or `href`). It's a best practice to use lowercase for tags and attributes for consistency.

13. **Q: What does `charset` mean in `<meta charset="UTF-8">`?**
    **A:** `charset` specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. `UTF-8` is a universal character set that includes almost all characters and symbols from all languages. Using `UTF-8` is highly recommended for web pages to ensure proper display of text.

14. **Q: What is the purpose of the `<title>` element?**
    **A:** The `<title>` element defines the title of the HTML document. The title is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab, used by search engines, and used as the default name for bookmarks. It's required in HTML documents and should be a concise, descriptive text.

15. **Q: What is the difference between block-level and inline elements? Give examples.**
    **A:**
    *   **Block-level elements:** Always start on a new line and take up the full width available. They can contain other block-level or inline elements. Examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<form>`, `<table>`.
    *   **Inline elements:** Do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are typically found within block-level elements or other inline elements. Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<input>`, `<label>`.

16. **Q: Can you put a block-level element inside an inline element?**
    **A:** Generally, no. It's semantically incorrect and can lead to validation errors or unexpected rendering. Inline elements are meant to contain data or other inline elements. However, the `<a>` tag is a notable exception in HTML5; it can wrap block-level content.

17. **Q: How can you represent special characters in HTML (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`)?**
    **A:** Using HTML entities (character entities).
    *   `<` is `&lt;` (less than)
    *   `>` is `&gt;` (greater than)
    *   `&` is `&amp;` (ampersand)
    *   `"` is `&quot;` (double quote)
    *   `'` is `&apos;` (single quote - not always necessary, `&#39;` is safer)
    *   ` ` (non-breaking space) is `&nbsp;`

18. **Q: What is the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag used for (e.g., `<html lang="en">`)?**
    **A:** The `lang` attribute specifies the primary language of the content within the element. Setting it on the `<html>` tag defines the language for the entire document. This helps search engines, screen readers, and browsers correctly process and display the content.

19. **Q: What is semantic HTML? Why is it important?**
    **A:** Semantic HTML refers to using HTML tags that accurately describe the meaning or purpose of the content they enclose, rather than just how they look. Examples: `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`, `<main>`.
    **Importance:**
    *   **Accessibility (a11y):** Helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure and meaning of the page.
    *   **SEO:** Helps search engines better understand the content and context of the page, potentially improving rankings.
    *   **Maintainability:** Makes the code easier to read and understand for developers.
    *   **Clarity:** Provides a clearer structure to the document.

20. **Q: What is the difference between `<b>` and `<strong>`, and `<i>` and `<em>`?**
    **A:**
    *   `<b>` (Bold) and `<i>` (Italic): These are presentational tags. They define bold and italic text, respectively, without conveying any special meaning or importance.
    *   `<strong>` and `<em>` (Emphasis): These are semantic tags.
        *   `<strong>` indicates that its content has strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers usually render this as bold.
        *   `<em>` indicates stress emphasis of its content. Browsers usually render this as italic.
    For semantic correctness and accessibility, prefer `<strong>` and `<em>` when you want to convey importance or emphasis. Use `<b>` and `<i>` only for stylistic purposes where no semantic meaning is implied (though CSS is generally preferred for styling).

**II. HTML Structure & Sections (21-30)**

21. **Q: What are HTML headings? How many levels are there?**
    **A:** HTML headings are used to define titles or subtitles for sections of a document. There are six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important). They create a document outline.

22. **Q: What is the `<p>` element used for?**
    **A:** The `<p>` element is used to define a paragraph of text. Browsers automatically add some space (margin) before and after each `<p>` element.

23. **Q: Explain the purpose of `<div>` and `<span>` elements.**
    **A:**
    *   `<div>` (Division): A generic block-level container used to group other HTML elements for styling (with CSS) or scripting (with JavaScript). It has no semantic meaning on its own.
    *   `<span>`: A generic inline container used to group inline-elements or parts of text for styling or scripting. It also has no semantic meaning on its own.

24. **Q: What is the `<header>` element in HTML5?**
    **A:** The `<header>` element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain heading elements, a logo, a search form, an author name, etc. A document can have multiple `<header>` elements.

25. **Q: What is the `<footer>` element in HTML5?**
    **A:** The `<footer>` element defines a footer for a document or section. A footer typically contains authorship information, copyright information, contact information, sitemap, back to top links, related documents, etc.

26. **Q: What is the `<nav>` element in HTML5?**
    **A:** The `<nav>` element defines a set of navigation links. It's intended for major blocks of navigation links, such as the main site navigation, table of contents, or previous/next links.

27. **Q: What is the `<article>` element in HTML5?**
    **A:** The `<article>` element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment).

28. **Q: What is the `<aside>` element in HTML5?**
    **A:** The `<aside>` element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are often presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.

29. **Q: What is the `<main>` element in HTML5?**
    **A:** The `<main>` element represents the dominant content of the `<body>` of a document. The content inside `<main>` should be unique to the document and not be repeated across a set of documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms (unless the search form is the main function of the page). There should only be one `<main>` element per document that is not hidden.

30. **Q: What is the `<section>` element in HTML5? How is it different from `<article>` and `<div>`?**
    **A:** The `<section>` element represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
    *   **`<section>` vs. `<article>`:** An `<article>` is self-contained and makes sense on its own, whereas a `<section>` is a part of a larger whole. An article can contain sections.
    *   **`<section>` vs. `<div>`:** Use `<section>` when the content has a clear thematic grouping that would make sense in the document's outline. Use `<div>` for generic grouping purely for styling or scripting purposes when no semantic meaning is implied.

---

**III. Lists, Links, and Images (31-40)**

31. **Q: What are the different types of lists in HTML?**
    **A:**
    *   **Unordered List (`<ul>`):** A list of items where the order does not matter. Items are typically marked with bullets. Uses `<li>` (list item) elements.
    *   **Ordered List (`<ol>`):** A list of items where the order is important. Items are typically marked with numbers or letters. Uses `<li>` elements.
    *   **Description List (Definition List) (`<dl>`):** A list of terms (`<dt>`) and their descriptions (`<dd>`).

32. **Q: How do you create a hyperlink in HTML? What are its important attributes?**
    **A:** Using the `<a>` (anchor) element.
    `HTML <a href="url">link text</a>`
    Important attributes:
    *   `href`: Specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
    *   `target`: Specifies where to open the linked document (e.g., `_blank` for a new tab/window, `_self` for the same frame).
    *   `rel`: Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document (e.g., `nofollow`, `noopener`).
    *   `title`: Provides advisory information about the element, often shown as a tooltip.

33. **Q: What is the difference between an absolute URL and a relative URL in `href`?**
    **A:**
    *   **Absolute URL:** A full web address, including the protocol (e.g., `https://www.example.com/page.html`). It points to a specific location on the web.
    *   **Relative URL:** A partial address that points to a file relative to the current page's location (e.g., `about.html`, `../images/pic.jpg`).

34. **Q: What is the purpose of the `target="_blank"` attribute in an anchor tag? What security consideration is associated with it?**
    **A:** `target="_blank"` opens the linked document in a new browser tab or window.
    **Security Consideration:** When using `target="_blank"`, the newly opened page gains access to the originating page's `window` object via `window.opener`. This can be a security risk (tabnabbing/phishing) if the linked page is malicious. To mitigate this, add `rel="noopener"` (prevents access to `window.opener`) or `rel="noreferrer"` (prevents access and also doesn't send the Referer header). Modern browsers often implicitly apply `noopener` behavior for `target="_blank"`.

35. **Q: How do you display an image on a web page? What are its important attributes?**
    **A:** Using the `<img>` element (a void element).
    `HTML <img src="image_path.jpg" alt="description of image">`
    Important attributes:
    *   `src`: Specifies the path (URL) to the image. (Required)
    *   `alt`: Specifies alternative text for the image if it cannot be displayed or for screen readers. Crucial for accessibility. (Required for meaningful images)
    *   `width`: Specifies the width of the image in pixels (or percentage).
    *   `height`: Specifies the height of the image in pixels (or percentage).
    *   `title`: Provides advisory information, often shown as a tooltip.
    *   `srcset` & `sizes`: For responsive images, allowing the browser to choose the best image from a set based on screen density or viewport size.

36. **Q: Why is the `alt` attribute important for `<img>` tags?**
    **A:** The `alt` (alternative text) attribute is crucial for:
    *   **Accessibility:** Screen readers read the `alt` text to visually impaired users, describing the image's content or function.
    *   **Broken Images:** If the image fails to load, the `alt` text is displayed in its place.
    *   **SEO:** Search engines can use `alt` text to understand the image content.
    If an image is purely decorative and provides no information, use an empty alt attribute (`alt=""`).

37. **Q: What is an image map? (`<map>` and `<area>`)**
    **A:** An image map allows you to define clickable areas (hotspots) within an image. The `<map>` element defines the image map, and `<area>` elements define the clickable regions (shape, coordinates, and `href`). The `<img>` tag uses the `usemap` attribute to link to the `<map>`.

38. **Q: How do you link to a specific part of the same HTML page (fragment identifier)?**
    **A:**
    1.  Give an ID to the element you want to link to: `<h2 id="section2">Section 2</h2>`
    2.  Create a link with `href` pointing to that ID using a hash: `<a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>`

39. **Q: What is the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` element used for?**
    **A:**
    *   `<figure>`: Represents self-contained content, like images, illustrations, diagrams, code snippets, etc., that are referenced in the main content but can be moved to another part of the page or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.
    *   `<figcaption>`: Provides a caption or legend for the content of its parent `<figure>` element. It should be the first or last child of the `<figure>`.
    ```html
    <figure>
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
      <figcaption>Fig.1 - A descriptive caption for the image.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    ```

40. **Q: How can you make an image a link?**
    **A:** Wrap the `<img>` element with an `<a>` (anchor) element:
    ```html
    <a href="https://example.com">
      <img src="image.png" alt="Link to Example">
    </a>
    ```

**IV. HTML Tables (41-50)**

41. **Q: How do you create a table in HTML? What are the basic table tags?**
    **A:** Tables are created using the `<table>` element.
    Basic tags:
    *   `<table>`: Defines the table.
    *   `<tr>`: Defines a table row.
    *   `<th>`: Defines a table header cell (usually bold and centered).
    *   `<td>`: Defines a table data cell.
    *   `<caption>`: Defines a table caption.
    *   `<thead>`: Groups header content in a table.
    *   `<tbody>`: Groups body content in a table.
    *   `<tfoot>`: Groups footer content in a table.

42. **Q: What is the purpose of `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` elements in a table?**
    **A:** These elements are used to group table rows into logical sections: header, body, and footer.
    *   `<thead>`: Contains header rows (e.g., column titles).
    *   `<tbody>`: Contains the main data rows of the table.
    *   `<tfoot>`: Contains footer rows (e.g., summaries, totals).
    They help with structuring the table, can assist assistive technologies, and allow for separate scrolling of the table body if supported by CSS and the browser. They also ensure the header/footer are printed on each page if the table spans multiple pages.

43. **Q: What are the `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes used for in table cells?**
    **A:**
    *   `colspan="number"`: Allows a cell (`<td>` or `<th>`) to span across multiple columns.
    *   `rowspan="number"`: Allows a cell to span across multiple rows.

44. **Q: How do you add a caption to a table?**
    **A:** Using the `<caption>` element, which should be the first child of the `<table>` element.
    ```html
    <table>
      <caption>Monthly Sales Data</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Month</th>
        <th>Sales</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>January</td>
        <td>$1000</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    ```

45. **Q: Is it good practice to use tables for page layout? Why or why not?**
    **A:** No, it is generally bad practice to use tables for page layout.
    Reasons:
    *   **Semantics:** Tables are for tabular data, not layout. Using them for layout is semantically incorrect.
    *   **Accessibility:** Screen readers may misinterpret layout tables, making content difficult to understand for users with disabilities.
    *   **Maintainability:** Table-based layouts are often complex and harder to maintain and update than CSS-based layouts.
    *   **Responsiveness:** Making table-based layouts responsive is very difficult.
    *   **Performance:** Browsers may need to load the entire table before rendering, potentially slowing down page display.
    CSS (e.g., Flexbox, Grid) should be used for page layout.

46. **Q: What is the `scope` attribute in `<th>` elements used for?**
    **A:** The `scope` attribute specifies whether a header cell (`<th>`) is a header for a column, row, or group of columns/rows. This improves table accessibility by helping screen readers associate data cells with their proper headers.
    Common values:
    *   `scope="col"`: The header is for a column.
    *   `scope="row"`: The header is for a row.
    *   `scope="colgroup"`: The header is for a column group.
    *   `scope="rowgroup"`: The header is for a row group.

47. **Q: What is the `<colgroup>` and `<col>` element used for in tables?**
    **A:**
    *   `<colgroup>`: Used to group one or more columns in a table for formatting.
    *   `<col>`: Used within `<colgroup>` to specify properties for each column or to span properties across multiple columns (using the `span` attribute). This is often used to apply styling (like background or width) to entire columns.
    ```html
    <table>
      <colgroup>
        <col style="background-color: #f0f0f0;">
        <col span="2" style="background-color: #e0e0e0;">
      </colgroup>
      <tr><th>Name</th><th>Age</th><th>City</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Alice</td><td>30</td><td>New York</td></tr>
    </table>
    ```

48. **Q: How can you ensure table headers are always visible when scrolling a long table (conceptually, as HTML alone doesn't do this)?**
    **A:** HTML alone does not provide a direct way to make table headers "sticky" during scrolling. This functionality is typically achieved using CSS (`position: sticky; top: 0;` on `<th>` elements within `<thead>`) or JavaScript for more complex scenarios. The `<thead>` and `<tbody>` structure helps in applying such styles.

49. **Q: What are some accessibility considerations when creating HTML tables?**
    **A:**
    *   Use `<caption>` to provide a title for the table.
    *   Use `<th>` for header cells and associate them with data cells using the `scope` attribute.
    *   For complex tables, use `id` on header cells and the `headers` attribute on data cells to explicitly link them.
    *   Ensure sufficient color contrast.
    *   Avoid using tables for layout.
    *   Ensure tables are responsive or provide a way to navigate them easily on small screens.

50. **Q: Can you nest tables? Is it recommended?**
    **A:** Yes, you can nest tables (put a `<table>` inside a `<td>` of another table). However, it is generally not recommended as it can lead to very complex markup, accessibility issues, and difficulties in styling and maintenance. It's often a sign that the data structure could be simplified or a different approach might be better.

**V. HTML Forms (51-65)**

51. **Q: What is the `<form>` element used for? What are its key attributes?**
    **A:** The `<form>` element is used to create an HTML form for user input.
    Key attributes:
    *   `action`: Specifies the URL where the form data should be sent when submitted.
    *   `method`: Specifies the HTTP method to use when submitting the form data (`GET` or `POST`).
    *   `enctype`: Specifies how the form data should be encoded when submitting (e.g., `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (default), `multipart/form-data` for file uploads, `text/plain`).
    *   `name`: Name of the form.
    *   `target`: Specifies where to display the response after submitting.
    *   `novalidate`: Boolean attribute to disable default browser validation.

52. **Q: What is the difference between `GET` and `POST` methods for form submission?**
    **A:**
    *   **`GET`:**
        *   Appends form data to the URL in name/value pairs (e.g., `url?name=value&name2=value2`).
        *   Has length limitations (URLs can only be so long).
        *   Should NOT be used for sensitive data (visible in URL, browser history, server logs).
        *   Idempotent (submitting multiple times has the same effect as submitting once).
        *   Good for search forms or when users might want to bookmark the result.
    *   **`POST`:**
        *   Sends form data in the HTTP request body.
        *   No size limitations for data.
        *   More secure for sensitive data (not visible in URL).
        *   Not idempotent (submitting multiple times can have different effects, e.g., creating multiple records).
        *   Used for updating data or when data is sensitive or large.

53. **Q: What are common `<input>` types? List at least 5.**
    **A:**
    *   `text`: Single-line text input.
    *   `password`: Text input where characters are masked.
    *   `checkbox`: Allows selecting zero or more options.
    *   `radio`: Allows selecting one option from a group (group defined by same `name` attribute).
    *   `submit`: A button that submits the form.
    *   `button`: A generic button.
    *   `file`: Allows users to select a file for upload.
    *   `email`: Text input validated for email format.
    *   `number`: Input for numeric values with spinners.
    *   `date`: Input for selecting a date.
    *   `hidden`: A hidden input field, often used to send data that the user doesn't see or interact with.

54. **Q: What is the purpose of the `<label>` element? How can it be associated with an input field?**
    **A:** The `<label>` element defines a label for an `<input>` element (or other form controls like `<textarea>`, `<select>`).
    Importance:
    *   **Accessibility:** Screen readers read the label when the input field gets focus, helping users understand what input is required.
    *   **Usability:** Clicking on the label focuses or activates the associated input control (especially useful for checkboxes and radio buttons).
    Association:
    1.  **Implicit:** Wrap the input element inside the `<label>`:
        ```html
        <label>Username: <input type="text" name="username"></label>
        ```
    2.  **Explicit (preferred):** Use the `for` attribute on the `<label>` and an `id` attribute on the input element with matching values:
        ```html
        <label for="username">Username:</label>
        <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
        ```

55. **Q: What is the `<textarea>` element used for?**
    **A:** The `<textarea>` element defines a multi-line text input control. Users can enter a larger amount of text compared to a single-line `<input type="text">`. Attributes like `rows` and `cols` can suggest its size.

56. **Q: What is the `<select>` element used for? How do you define its options?**
    **A:** The `<select>` element is used to create a drop-down list.
    Options are defined using `<option>` elements nested within the `<select>` element.
    ```html
    <label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>
    <select id="cars" name="cars">
      <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
      <option value="saab">Saab</option>
      <option value="mercedes" selected>Mercedes</option> <!-- 'selected' makes it default -->
      <option value="audi">Audi</option>
    </select>
    ```
    The `value` attribute of the `<option>` is what gets sent to the server.

57. **Q: What is the `<button>` element? How is it different from `<input type="submit">`?**
    **A:** The `<button>` element represents a clickable button.
    Differences from `<input type="submit">`:
    *   **Content:** `<button>` can contain HTML content (like text, images, or other elements), offering more styling flexibility. `<input type="submit">` can only display plain text defined by its `value` attribute.
    *   **`type` attribute:** `<button>` has a `type` attribute that can be `submit` (default, submits the form), `reset` (resets form fields), or `button` (a generic button, often used with JavaScript). `<input type="submit">` is always a submit button.
    Generally, `<button type="submit">Submit</button>` is preferred over `<input type="submit" value="Submit">` for its flexibility.

58. **Q: What is the purpose of the `name` attribute on form input elements?**
    **A:** The `name` attribute is crucial. When a form is submitted, only input elements with a `name` attribute will have their values sent to the server. The `name` attribute serves as the key, and the input's content serves as the value in the submitted data (e.g., `username=JohnDoe`). For radio buttons, the same `name` attribute groups them together.

59. **Q: What is the `value` attribute used for in different input types?**
    **A:**
    *   **`text`, `password`, `hidden`, `email`, `number`, etc.:** Specifies the initial value of the input field. It's also the value that gets submitted.
    *   **`checkbox`, `radio`:** Defines the value associated with the input that is sent to the server if that option is selected. This value is not displayed to the user.
    *   **`submit`, `reset`, `button`:** Defines the text displayed on the button.
    *   **`<option>` (inside `<select>`):** Defines the value that is sent to the server if that option is selected.

60. **Q: What is the purpose of the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements?**
    **A:**
    *   `<fieldset>`: Used to group related elements in a form. It draws a box around the related elements.
    *   `<legend>`: Defines a caption or title for the `<fieldset>` element.
    This improves the structure and accessibility of complex forms.
    ```html
    <form>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Personal Information:</legend>
        <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
        <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">
      </fieldset>
    </form>
    ```

61. **Q: How can you make an input field required in HTML5?**
    **A:** By adding the boolean `required` attribute to the `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>` element.
    ```html
    <input type="text" name="username" required>
    ```
    The browser will prevent form submission if a required field is empty.

62. **Q: What are some HTML5 input validation attributes? (e.g., `pattern`, `min`, `max`)**
    **A:**
    *   `required`: Specifies that the field must be filled out.
    *   `pattern="regex"`: Specifies a regular expression the input's value must match.
    *   `min="number"` and `max="number"`: For numeric input types (`number`, `range`, `date`), specifies minimum and maximum allowed values.
    *   `minlength="number"` and `maxlength="number"`: Specifies minimum and maximum length for text inputs.
    *   `type="email"`, `type="url"`: Provide built-in validation for email and URL formats.
    *   `step="number"`: For numeric input types, specifies the legal number intervals.

63. **Q: What is the `placeholder` attribute?**
    **A:** The `placeholder` attribute provides a short hint or example text that describes the expected value of an input field. This hint is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value and disappears when the field gets focus or input. It should not be used as a replacement for a `<label>`.

64. **Q: How do you allow file uploads in a form?**
    **A:**
    1.  Use `<input type="file" name="myFile">`.
    2.  Set the `<form>` element's `enctype` attribute to `multipart/form-data`.
    3.  Set the `<form>` element's `method` attribute to `POST`.
    ```html
    <form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <label for="fileUpload">Select a file:</label>
      <input type="file" id="fileUpload" name="myFile">
      <input type="submit" value="Upload">
    </form>
    ```

65. **Q: What is the `disabled` attribute in form elements?**
    **A:** The boolean `disabled` attribute, when present, specifies that an input element should be disabled. A disabled input is unusable and un-clickable, and its value will not be sent when the form is submitted. Browsers usually render disabled inputs as grayed out.

---

**VI. Multimedia & Embedding (66-75)**

66. **Q: How do you embed audio in an HTML page? What are common attributes?**
    **A:** Using the `<audio>` element.
    ```html
    <audio controls>
      <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
      Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
    ```
    Common attributes for `<audio>`:
    *   `controls`: Displays standard audio controls (play, pause, volume).
    *   `autoplay`: Starts playing the audio automatically when the page loads (often restricted by browsers).
    *   `loop`: Repeats the audio once it finishes.
    *   `muted`: Mutes the audio by default.
    *   `preload`: Hints to the browser how the audio file should be loaded (`auto`, `metadata`, `none`).
    *   `src`: (Can be used directly on `<audio>` if only one source) Specifies the URL of the audio file.
    The `<source>` element allows specifying multiple audio formats.

67. **Q: How do you embed video in an HTML page? What are common attributes?**
    **A:** Using the `<video>` element.
    ```html
    <video width="320" height="240" controls>
      <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    ```
    Common attributes for `<video>` (many are similar to `<audio>`):
    *   `controls`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `muted`, `preload`, `src`.
    *   `width` and `height`: Set the dimensions of the video player.
    *   `poster`: Specifies an image to be shown while the video is downloading, or until the user hits the play button.

68. **Q: What is the purpose of the `<source>` element within `<audio>` and `<video>`?**
    **A:** The `<source>` element allows you to specify multiple media resources (different file formats or codecs) for the `<audio>` or `<video>` element. The browser will choose the first source it supports. This is useful for cross-browser compatibility, as not all browsers support the same media formats.

69. **Q: What is the `<track>` element used for with media elements?**
    **A:** The `<track>` element is used to specify timed text tracks (or other time-based data) for media elements (`<audio>` or `<video>`).
    Common uses:
    *   Subtitles (`kind="subtitles"`)
    *   Captions (`kind="captions"`) for hearing-impaired users.
    *   Descriptions (`kind="descriptions"`) for visually impaired users.
    *   Chapters (`kind="chapters"`) for navigation.
    *   Metadata (`kind="metadata"`).
    It requires a `src` attribute pointing to a WebVTT file (`.vtt`).

70. **Q: What is an `<iframe>`? What are some use cases and security concerns?**
    **A:** An `<iframe>` (Inline Frame) is used to embed another HTML document within the current HTML document.
    Use Cases:
    *   Embedding third-party content (e.g., YouTube videos, Google Maps, social media widgets).
    *   Displaying ads.
    *   Integrating separate web applications.
    Security Concerns:
    *   **Clickjacking:** Malicious sites can overlay an invisible iframe over legitimate buttons, tricking users into performing unintended actions. Mitigated by `X-Frame-Options` HTTP header or CSP `frame-ancestors` directive.
    *   **Content Security:** Content within an iframe runs in its own context, but poorly configured iframes or vulnerable embedded content can still pose risks.
    *   **`sandbox` attribute:** Can be used to restrict the capabilities of the content within the iframe (e.g., prevent script execution, form submission).

71. **Q: What is the difference between `<object>` and `<embed>` elements?**
    **A:** Both can be used to embed various types of external content (like plugins, PDFs, Flash animations - though Flash is obsolete).
    *   `<object>`: More versatile and standards-based. It can embed a wider range of media types and can have fallback content if the primary content cannot be loaded. It uses `<param>` elements to pass parameters to the plugin.
    *   `<embed>`: Simpler but less flexible. It was originally a non-standard tag but is now part of HTML5. It directly uses attributes for parameters.
    For modern web development, specific elements like `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<img>`, and `<iframe>` are generally preferred. `<object>` might still be used for certain plugin-based content or vector graphics like SVG (though inline SVG is often better).

72. **Q: How do you embed an SVG image in HTML? What are the advantages?**
    **A:**
    1.  **Inline SVG:** Directly write the `<svg>` code within your HTML.
        ```html
        <svg width="100" height="100">
          <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
        </svg>
        ```
    2.  **Using `<img>` tag:** `<img src="image.svg" alt="SVG Image">`
    3.  **Using `<object>` tag:** `<object data="image.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>`
    4.  **As a CSS background-image.**
    Advantages of SVG:
    *   **Scalability:** Vector-based, so they scale to any size without loss of quality.
    *   **Small File Size:** Often smaller than raster images for simple graphics.
    *   **Stylable with CSS:** Inline SVGs can be styled with CSS.
    *   **Scriptable with JavaScript:** Inline SVGs can be manipulated with JavaScript.
    *   **Accessibility:** Can include `<title>` and `<desc>` elements for accessibility.

73. **Q: What is the `<canvas>` element used for?**
    **A:** The `<canvas>` element is used to draw graphics, animations, or other visual images on the fly, typically using JavaScript. It provides a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas. You draw on it using its 2D rendering context (or WebGL for 3D).

74. **Q: Can you directly put text content inside a `<canvas>` element?**
    **A:** Text content placed directly between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` tags is fallback content, displayed only if the browser does not support the `<canvas>` element. To draw text *onto* the canvas itself, you need to use JavaScript and the canvas 2D rendering context API (e.g., `context.fillText()`).

75. **Q: What is HTML5 Geolocation API used for (conceptually, as it's a JS API)?**
    **A:** The HTML5 Geolocation API allows web applications to (with user permission) retrieve the geographical position of the user's device. While the API is JavaScript-based (`navigator.geolocation`), HTML might be used to display the location data or provide UI elements to trigger the request. There isn't a specific HTML *element* for geolocation itself.

**VII. Accessibility (a11y) & Semantics (76-85)**

76. **Q: What does ARIA stand for? What is its purpose?**
    **A:** ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It's a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities, especially when using assistive technologies like screen readers. ARIA helps define roles, states, and properties for UI elements that aren't natively conveyed by standard HTML.

77. **Q: Give an example of an ARIA attribute and its use.**
    **A:** `aria-label`: Provides an accessible label for an element when there isn't visible label text, or when the visible text is ambiguous.
    ```html
    <button aria-label="Close dialog">X</button>
    ```
    Here, a screen reader would announce "Close dialog button" instead of just "X button".
    Other examples: `role`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-required`, `aria-expanded`.

78. **Q: What is the `role` attribute in ARIA?**
    **A:** The `role` attribute defines the specific purpose or type of an element, often overriding or clarifying its native HTML semantics. For example, you might use `role="button"` on a `<div>` styled to look like a button (though using a native `<button>` is preferred) or `role="navigation"` on a `<div>` containing navigation links (though `<nav>` is preferred). It's crucial for custom UI widgets.

79. **Q: When should you use ARIA roles versus native HTML semantic elements?**
    **A:** Always prefer using native HTML semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<input type="checkbox">`, etc.) whenever possible. They have built-in accessibility features, keyboard support, and semantics. Use ARIA roles only when:
    *   The desired semantics are not available with native HTML (e.g., for complex widgets like a tab panel or tree view).
    *   You are retrofitting accessibility onto legacy code where changing the HTML structure is difficult.
    The first rule of ARIA is "Don't use ARIA" if a native HTML element or attribute provides the same functionality.

80. **Q: What is the purpose of "skip links" (or "skip navigation links")?**
    **A:** Skip links are internal page links, usually placed at the very top of a page, that allow keyboard users and screen reader users to bypass large blocks of repetitive content (like main navigation menus or headers) and jump directly to the main content of the page. They are often visually hidden until focused.
    ```html
    <body>
      <a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
      <header>...</header>
      <main id="main-content">...</main>
    </body>
    ```

81. **Q: How can you ensure your website is keyboard accessible?**
    **A:**
    *   Ensure all interactive elements (`<a>`, `<button>`, form controls) are focusable and operable using the keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space).
    *   Avoid using JavaScript to create click handlers on non-interactive elements (like `<div>`s) without also adding `tabindex="0"` and keyboard event handlers (Enter/Space).
    *   Maintain a logical focus order.
    *   Provide visible focus indicators.
    *   Implement keyboard navigation for custom widgets if native elements aren't used.

82. **Q: Why is it important to have a logical document outline using headings (`<h1>`-`<h6>`)?**
    **A:** A logical heading structure:
    *   Improves accessibility: Screen reader users can navigate a page by its headings to quickly understand its structure and find content.
    *   Enhances SEO: Search engines use headings to understand the topics and hierarchy of content.
    *   Improves readability and maintainability for developers.
    There should typically be only one `<h1>` per page (for the main title), and heading levels should not be skipped (e.g., don't go from `<h2>` to `<h4>` without an `<h3>`).

83. **Q: What is the `tabindex` attribute used for?**
    **A:** The `tabindex` attribute controls whether an element is focusable and how it participates in sequential keyboard navigation (using the Tab key).
    *   `tabindex="0"`: Makes an element focusable in its natural order in the source code. Useful for making non-interactive elements like `<div>` or `<span>` focusable when they are made interactive with JavaScript.
    *   `tabindex="-1"`: Makes an element focusable via JavaScript (`element.focus()`) but removes it from the natural tab order. Useful for elements that should be programmatically focused, like modals when they open.
    *   `tabindex="positive_integer"` (e.g., `tabindex="1"`, `tabindex="2"`): **Avoid using positive values.** It explicitly defines the tab order, which can create confusing and inaccessible experiences for keyboard users, overriding the natural document flow.

84. **Q: What are landmarks in HTML (e.g., `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`) and why are they important for accessibility?**
    **A:** HTML5 semantic elements like `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` (and ARIA landmark roles like `role="search"`) define landmark regions on a page. Screen readers and other assistive technologies can use these landmarks to allow users to quickly navigate to different sections of the page, improving their ability to understand the page structure and find information efficiently.

85. **Q: What is the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query and how might it relate to HTML content?**
    **A:** `prefers-reduced-motion` is a CSS media query that detects if the user has requested the system to minimize the amount of non-essential motion it uses.
    Relation to HTML: While it's primarily a CSS concern, JavaScript interacting with HTML might check this setting to:
    *   Disable or reduce animations triggered on HTML elements (e.g., parallax scrolling, animated GIFs via `<picture>`/`<source>`, complex transitions).
    *   Provide alternative, static content instead of animated content.
    This ensures a better experience for users sensitive to motion.

**VIII. Meta Information & Document Structure (86-95)**

86. **Q: What are `<meta>` tags? List a few common ones and their purpose.**
    **A:** `<meta>` tags provide metadata about the HTML document. They are placed within the `<head>` section.
    Common ones:
    *   `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding.
    *   `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Configures the viewport for responsive design on mobile devices.
    *   `<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the page content.">`: Used by search engines.
    *   `<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2">`: (Less important for SEO now) Provides keywords related to the page content.
    *   `<meta name="author" content="Author Name">`: Specifies the author of the page.
    *   `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30;url=https://example.com">`: Refreshes the page or redirects after a delay.

87. **Q: What is the viewport meta tag (`<meta name="viewport" ...>`) used for?**
    **A:** `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` is crucial for responsive web design.
    *   `width=device-width`: Sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen.
    *   `initial-scale=1.0`: Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
    This ensures that web pages are displayed correctly and scaled appropriately on different devices, especially mobile phones and tablets.

88. **Q: What is the purpose of the `<link>` tag? What are common uses?**
    **A:** The `<link>` tag defines a link between the current document and an external resource. It's most commonly placed in the `<head>` section.
    Common uses:
    *   Linking to external CSS stylesheets: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
    *   Defining a favicon: `<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">`
    *   Linking to preloaded or prefetched resources: `<link rel="preload" href="font.woff2" as="font">`
    *   Specifying canonical URLs: `<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/page.html">`

89. **Q: How do you include external JavaScript files in an HTML document? Where should you typically place them?**
    **A:** Using the `<script>` tag with the `src` attribute:
    `<script src="path/to/script.js"></script>`
    Placement:
    *   **Traditionally in `<head>`:** If the script needs to execute before the DOM is fully parsed (less common for app logic). Can block rendering if not `async` or `defer`.
    *   **End of `<body>` (before `</body>`):** Most common and often recommended for application scripts. This allows the HTML content to parse and render first, improving perceived page load speed. The script can then safely manipulate the DOM.
    *   **In `<head>` with `defer` attribute:** The script is downloaded asynchronously alongside HTML parsing and executed after the document has been parsed, but before the `DOMContentLoaded` event. Order of execution is maintained for multiple `defer` scripts.
    *   **In `<head>` with `async` attribute:** The script is downloaded asynchronously and executed as soon as it's available, potentially interrupting HTML parsing. Order of execution is not guaranteed for multiple `async` scripts.

90. **Q: What are the `async` and `defer` attributes for the `<script>` tag?**
    **A:**
    *   **`async`:**
        *   The script is downloaded asynchronously (doesn't block HTML parsing).
        *   The script is executed as soon as it finishes downloading, which can happen before the HTML document is fully parsed. This can interrupt parsing.
        *   Order of execution for multiple `async` scripts is not guaranteed.
        *   Useful for independent scripts like analytics.
    *   **`defer`:**
        *   The script is downloaded asynchronously (doesn't block HTML parsing).
        *   The script is executed *after* the HTML document has been fully parsed, but before the `DOMContentLoaded` event fires.
        *   Order of execution is maintained for multiple `defer` scripts (they execute in the order they appear in the document).
        *   Generally preferred for non-critical scripts that need the full DOM.

91. **Q: What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?**
    **A:**
    *   **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** More lenient syntax.
    *   **XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language):** A stricter, XML-based version of HTML.
    Key differences in XHTML:
    *   Must be well-formed XML (all tags must be properly nested and closed).
    *   Void elements must be self-closed (e.g., `<br />`).
    *   Attribute values must be quoted.
    *   Attribute minimization is forbidden (e.g., must use `checked="checked"` instead of just `checked`).
    *   Tag and attribute names must be lowercase.
    HTML5 has adopted a more forgiving syntax similar to HTML4 but also incorporates ideas from XHTML for well-formedness where practical. For most modern web development, "HTML" refers to HTML5.

92. **Q: What are `data-*` attributes? Why use them?**
    **A:** `data-*` attributes are custom data attributes that allow you to store private, custom data associated with an HTML element. The syntax is `data-yourname="value"`.
    Why use them:
    *   To store extra information on an element that your JavaScript can use, without misusing standard attributes or creating invalid ones.
    *   For progressive enhancement or providing hints to scripts.
    The data can be accessed in JavaScript using `element.dataset.yourname` (if `data-yourname`) or `element.getAttribute('data-yourname')`.

93. **Q: What is the HTML Document Object Model (DOM)?**
    **A:** The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page structure as a tree of objects (nodes), where each node represents a part of the document (e.g., an element, text, comment). JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically read and modify the content, structure, and style of a web page. HTML is the markup that defines the initial structure of this DOM tree.

94. **Q: How does a browser render an HTML page (brief overview)?**
    **A:**
    1.  **Parsing HTML:** The browser reads the HTML markup and builds a DOM (Document Object Model) tree.
    2.  **Parsing CSS:** It parses linked and inline CSS to build a CSSOM (CSS Object Model) tree.
    3.  **Render Tree Construction:** The DOM and CSSOM are combined to form a Render Tree, which includes only the visible elements with their computed styles.
    4.  **Layout (Reflow):** The browser calculates the exact position and size of each element in the Render Tree.
    5.  **Painting (Rasterization):** The browser "paints" the pixels on the screen based on the Render Tree and layout information.
    6.  **Compositing (if layers are used):** Combines different layers of the page.
    JavaScript execution can modify the DOM/CSSOM, potentially triggering re-layouts and re-paints.

95. **Q: What does it mean for HTML to be "forgiving"?**
    **A:** HTML is designed to be forgiving, meaning browsers will try their best to render a page even if the HTML contains syntax errors (like unclosed tags or improperly nested elements). While this can make it easier for beginners, it can also lead to inconsistent rendering across browsers and make debugging harder. Writing valid, well-formed HTML is always recommended. XHTML, in contrast, is not forgiving and requires strict XML syntax.

**IX. Advanced & Best Practices (96-100)**

96. **Q: What are some best practices for writing clean and maintainable HTML?**
    **A:**
    *   **Use Semantic HTML:** Choose tags that accurately describe the content.
    *   **Validate Your HTML:** Use tools like the W3C Validator.
    *   **Proper Indentation and Formatting:** Makes code easier to read.
    *   **Use `alt` Text for Images.**
    *   **Keep CSS and JavaScript Separate:** Link external files rather than using excessive inline styles or scripts.
    *   **Minimize Nesting of `div`s:** Use semantic elements where possible.
    *   **Write Comments for Complex Sections.**
    *   **Follow a Consistent Naming Convention for `id`s and `class`es.**
    *   **Ensure Accessibility.**
    *   **Use lowercase for tags and attributes.**

97. **Q: What is the purpose of an HTML validator?**
    **A:** An HTML validator is a tool that checks your HTML markup against the official W3C HTML standards. It helps identify syntax errors, structural problems, and potential accessibility issues. Using a validator ensures your code is well-formed, more likely to render consistently across browsers, and easier to maintain.

98. **Q: Explain the concept of "Progressive Enhancement" in web development and HTML's role.**
    **A:** Progressive Enhancement is a strategy where you build a website with a baseline of core content and functionality accessible to all users and browsers (using standard HTML for structure and content). Then, you add layers of enhancements (CSS for presentation, JavaScript for interactivity) that are available to users with more capable browsers or faster connections.
    HTML's role is foundational: it provides the semantic structure and core content that works everywhere, even if CSS or JS fails to load or is disabled.

99. **Q: How can HTML be used to improve website performance (e.g., lazy loading, preloading)?**
    **A:**
    *   **Lazy Loading Images:** Use the `loading="lazy"` attribute on `<img>` and `<iframe>` tags to defer loading of off-screen images/iframes until the user scrolls near them.
    *   **Preloading Resources:** Use `<link rel="preload" href="resource_url" as="type">` to tell the browser to fetch critical resources (scripts, styles, fonts) earlier in the page load process.
    *   **Prefetching Resources:** Use `<link rel="prefetch" href="resource_url">` to hint to the browser that a resource might be needed for future navigation, so it can fetch it during idle time.
    *   **Minimize Markup:** Write efficient, clean HTML to reduce file size.
    *   **Responsive Images:** Use `<picture>` element or `<img>` with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to serve appropriately sized images for different devices.
    *   **Async/Defer Scripts:** Use `async` or `defer` on `<script>` tags to prevent render-blocking.

100. **Q: What is the difference between `id` and `class` attributes?**
     **A:**
     *   **`id` (Identifier):**
         *   Must be **unique** within the entire HTML document. An element can only have one `id`.
         *   Used to uniquely identify an element, often for JavaScript manipulation (`document.getElementById()`) or for fragment identifiers in URLs (`#my-id`).
         *   Can be used for CSS styling, but `class` is generally preferred for styling multiple elements.
     *   **`class` (Classification):**
         *   Can be applied to **multiple** elements. An element can have **multiple** class names (space-separated: `class="class1 class2"`).
         *   Primarily used for applying CSS styles to groups of elements or for targeting multiple elements with JavaScript (`document.getElementsByClassName()` or `document.querySelectorAll('.my-class')`).

---

Phew! That's a lot of HTML. I hope this is comprehensive enough for your needs!
