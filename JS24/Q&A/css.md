## CSS Interview Questions

---

**I. CSS Basics & Syntax (1-20)**

1.  **Q: What is CSS?**
    **A:** CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation (look and formatting) of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS separates content (HTML) from presentation.

2.  **Q: What are the three main ways to include CSS in an HTML document?**
    **A:**
    1.  **Inline Styles:** Using the `style` attribute directly on an HTML element (e.g., `<p style="color: blue;">`).
    2.  **Internal/Embedded Styles:** Using the `<style>` element within the `<head>` section of an HTML document.
    3.  **External Stylesheets:** Linking to an external `.css` file using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section (e.g., `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`). This is the most common and recommended method.

3.  **Q: What is the basic syntax of a CSS rule?**
    **A:** A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block:
    ```css
    selector {
      property: value; /* This is a declaration */
      property2: value2;
    }
    ```
    *   **Selector:** Points to the HTML element(s) you want to style.
    *   **Declaration Block:** Contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
    *   **Declaration:** Consists of a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

4.  **Q: What are CSS selectors? Give a few examples.**
    **A:** CSS selectors are patterns used to select the HTML elements you want to style.
    Examples:
    *   **Element Selector:** `p` (selects all `<p>` elements)
    *   **ID Selector:** `#myId` (selects the element with `id="myId"`)
    *   **Class Selector:** `.myClass` (selects all elements with `class="myClass"`)
    *   **Attribute Selector:** `[type="text"]` (selects elements with `type="text"`)
    *   **Universal Selector:** `*` (selects all elements)
    *   **Descendant Selector:** `div p` (selects all `<p>` elements inside `<div>` elements)
    *   **Child Selector:** `div > p` (selects all `<p>` elements that are direct children of `<div>` elements)

5.  **Q: What does "Cascading" in CSS refer to?**
    **A:** "Cascading" refers to the order in which CSS rules are applied and how conflicts between rules are resolved. The browser follows a specific order of precedence:
    1.  **Origin and Importance:** Browser default styles < User styles < Author styles < Author `!important` styles < User `!important` styles < Browser `!important` styles.
    2.  **Specificity:** More specific selectors override less specific ones.
    3.  **Source Order:** If specificity is equal, the later rule in the stylesheet or the later stylesheet linked takes precedence.

6.  **Q: What is CSS Specificity? How is it calculated (conceptually)?**
    **A:** Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied if multiple rules target the same element and property. More specific selectors have higher precedence.
    Conceptual calculation (often represented as `a,b,c,d`):
    *   **Inline styles (`a`):** Highest specificity (e.g., `style="..."`).
    *   **IDs (`b`):** (e.g., `#myId`).
    *   **Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors (`c`):** (e.g., `.myClass`, `:hover`, `[type="text"]`).
    *   **Elements and pseudo-elements (`d`):** (e.g., `p`, `::before`).
    The universal selector (`*`) and combinators (`+`, `>`, `~`, ' ') have no specificity value themselves but contribute to the specificity of the overall selector. `!important` overrides all specificity.

7.  **Q: What is the `!important` rule in CSS? When might you use it (and why is it generally discouraged)?**
    **A:** `!important` is a keyword that can be added to a CSS declaration to give it the highest precedence, overriding any other declaration for that property on that element, regardless of specificity or source order.
    **When to use (cautiously):**
    *   Overriding styles from third-party libraries or user agent stylesheets when other methods are too complex.
    *   Utility classes that are meant to always apply (e.g., a `.hidden` class).
    **Why discouraged:** It breaks the natural cascade and makes debugging harder. Overuse leads to "specificity wars" where `!important` is needed everywhere. It's better to use higher specificity or better CSS organization.

8.  **Q: What are comments in CSS? How do you write them?**
    **A:** Comments are notes or explanations in CSS code that are ignored by the browser.
    Syntax: `/* This is a CSS comment */`
    CSS does not support single-line comments like `//`.

9.  **Q: What are the different CSS units for length? Give examples.**
    **A:**
    *   **Absolute Units:** Fixed and will appear as exactly that size.
        *   `px`: Pixels (most common for screen media).
        *   `pt`: Points (1pt = 1/72 of an inch).
        *   `cm`, `mm`, `in`: Centimeters, millimeters, inches.
    *   **Relative Units:** Relative to another length property.
        *   `em`: Relative to the font-size of the parent element (for font-size) or the element itself (for other properties like `width`, `margin`).
        *   `rem`: (Root em) Relative to the font-size of the root (`<html>`) element. Excellent for scalable layouts.
        *   `%`: Relative to the parent element's property value (e.g., `width: 50%` is half the parent's width).
        *   `vw`: 1% of the viewport width.
        *   `vh`: 1% of the viewport height.
        *   `vmin`: 1% of the viewport's smaller dimension.
        *   `vmax`: 1% of the viewport's larger dimension.

10. **Q: What is the difference between `em` and `rem` units?**
    **A:**
    *   `em`: Relative to the font-size of its direct parent element (if used for `font-size`) or the font-size of the element itself (if used for other properties like `padding`, `width`). This can lead to compounding if nested.
    *   `rem` (Root em): Relative to the font-size of the root (`<html>`) element. This provides a more predictable way to scale elements and fonts consistently across the entire page, as it's always based on a single source.

11. **Q: How do you select an element with a specific ID?**
    **A:** Using the ID selector, which starts with a hash (`#`) followed by the ID name.
    ```css
    #myElement {
      color: red;
    }
    ```
    HTML: `<div id="myElement">...</div>`

12. **Q: How do you select elements with a specific class?**
    **A:** Using the class selector, which starts with a period (`.`) followed by the class name.
    ```css
    .highlight {
      background-color: yellow;
    }
    ```
    HTML: `<p class="highlight">This is highlighted.</p>`

13. **Q: How can you select multiple elements with different selectors in a single rule?**
    **A:** By grouping selectors, separating them with a comma.
    ```css
    h1, h2, .important-text {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      color: navy;
    }
    ```

14. **Q: What is the universal selector (`*`)? When might it be used?**
    **A:** The universal selector (`*`) selects all HTML elements on the page.
    Uses:
    *   **Resetting Styles:** Often used in CSS resets to remove default browser margins/paddings (e.g., `* { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }`).
    *   Applying a very general style, though it's often better to be more specific.
    It has low specificity.

15. **Q: What are attribute selectors? Give an example.**
    **A:** Attribute selectors select elements based on the presence or value of their attributes.
    Examples:
    *   `[target]` (selects elements with a `target` attribute)
    *   `[type="submit"]` (selects elements with `type` attribute value of "submit")
    *   `a[href^="https"]` (selects `<a>` elements whose `href` attribute value starts with "https")
    *   `img[alt~="dog"]` (selects `<img>` elements whose `alt` attribute value contains the word "dog", space-separated)

16. **Q: What are pseudo-classes? Give a few common examples.**
    **A:** Pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected element(s).
    Common examples:
    *   `:hover` (when the mouse is over an element)
    *   `:active` (when an element is being activated, e.g., clicked)
    *   `:focus` (when an element has keyboard focus)
    *   `:visited` (for `<a>` elements that have been visited)
    *   `:nth-child(n)` (selects elements based on their position among siblings)
    *   `:first-child`, `:last-child`
    *   `:disabled`, `:checked` (for form elements)

17. **Q: What are pseudo-elements? Give a few common examples.**
    **A:** Pseudo-elements are keywords added to selectors that let you style a specific part of the selected element(s). They are typically denoted with a double colon `::` (though single colon `:` is supported for older ones for backward compatibility).
    Common examples:
    *   `::before` (inserts content before the content of an element)
    *   `::after` (inserts content after the content of an element)
    *   `::first-line` (styles the first line of a block-level element)
    *   `::first-letter` (styles the first letter of a block-level element)
    *   `::selection` (styles the portion of a document that has been highlighted by the user)
    *   `::placeholder` (styles the placeholder text in form fields)

18. **Q: Explain the difference between child selector (`>`) and descendant selector (space).**
    **A:**
    *   **Descendant Selector (space):** `div p` selects all `<p>` elements that are descendants of a `<div>` element, no matter how deeply nested.
    *   **Child Selector (`>`):** `div > p` selects only those `<p>` elements that are *direct children* of a `<div>` element.

19. **Q: What is CSS inheritance?**
    **A:** Inheritance is a mechanism by which certain CSS properties applied to a parent element are also applied (inherited) by its child elements, unless explicitly overridden on the child.
    Properties that are typically inherited include font properties (`font-family`, `font-size`, `color`), text properties (`text-align`, `line-height`), and list properties. Properties related to layout and box model (like `width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, `border`) are generally not inherited.

20. **Q: How can you explicitly make a property inherit its value from its parent?**
    **A:** By using the `inherit` keyword as the value for the property.
    ```css
    .child-element {
      color: inherit; /* Explicitly inherit the color from the parent */
    }
    ```

**II. Box Model (21-30)**

21. **Q: What is the CSS Box Model? What are its components?**
    **A:** The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how HTML elements are rendered as rectangular boxes on a web page. Each box consists of four parts, layered from innermost to outermost:
    1.  **Content:** The actual content of the box (text, images, etc.).
    2.  **Padding:** Transparent space around the content, inside the border.
    3.  **Border:** A line around the padding and content.
    4.  **Margin:** Transparent space around the border, separating the box from other elements.

22. **Q: What is the difference between `padding` and `margin`?**
    **A:**
    *   `padding`: Space *inside* the border, between the content and the border. Padding is part of the element's background.
    *   `margin`: Space *outside* the border, creating separation between the element and its neighbors. Margin is transparent.

23. **Q: What is the `box-sizing` property? What are its common values?**
    **A:** The `box-sizing` property controls how the total width and height of an element are calculated.
    Common values:
    *   `content-box` (default): The `width` and `height` properties apply only to the content area. Padding, border, and margin are added *outside* of this specified width/height.
        *   Total width = `width` + `padding-left` + `padding-right` + `border-left` + `border-right`
    *   `border-box`: The `width` and `height` properties include the content, padding, and border, but not the margin. Padding and border are drawn *inside* the specified width/height.
        *   Total width = `width` (which includes padding and border)
    Using `box-sizing: border-box;` is often preferred as it makes sizing elements more intuitive. A common practice is to set it globally:
    ```css
    *, *::before, *::after {
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    ```

24. **Q: What is margin collapsing?**
    **A:** Margin collapsing occurs when the vertical margins (top and bottom) of two or more adjacent block-level elements combine (collapse) into a single margin whose size is the largest of the individual margins. This only happens for vertical margins, not horizontal ones.
    It can happen between:
    *   Adjacent sibling elements.
    *   Parent and its first/last child (if there's no border, padding, or inline content between them).
    *   Empty blocks.

25. **Q: How can you prevent margin collapsing?**
    **A:**
    *   Add padding or a border to the parent element (prevents collapse between parent and child).
    *   Use `overflow` values other than `visible` (e.g., `overflow: auto` or `hidden`) on the parent.
    *   Use Flexbox or Grid layout for the parent container, as their items do not have collapsing margins.
    *   Create a new Block Formatting Context (BFC) for one of the elements.

26. **Q: How do `width` and `height` properties work with inline elements?**
    **A:** The `width` and `height` properties generally have no effect on non-replaced inline elements (like `<span>`, `<a>`). Their dimensions are determined by their content. For replaced inline elements like `<img>`, `width` and `height` can be applied. To set dimensions on a non-replaced inline element, you often need to change its `display` property (e.g., to `inline-block` or `block`).

27. **Q: What are the `min-width`/`max-width` and `min-height`/`max-height` properties used for?**
    **A:** These properties are used to set minimum and maximum constraints on the dimensions of an element:
    *   `min-width`: Sets the minimum width an element can be.
    *   `max-width`: Sets the maximum width an element can be. Prevents an element from becoming wider than a certain limit, useful for responsive design.
    *   `min-height`: Sets the minimum height.
    *   `max-height`: Sets the maximum height.
    These override `width` and `height` if they conflict.

28. **Q: Explain the `border` shorthand property.**
    **A:** The `border` shorthand property sets all the border properties for an element in one declaration.
    Syntax: `border: width style color;`
    Example: `border: 1px solid black;`
    You can also set borders for individual sides: `border-top`, `border-right`, `border-bottom`, `border-left`.

29. **Q: What is `outline` in CSS? How is it different from `border`?**
    **A:** The `outline` property draws a line around an element, outside the border.
    Differences from `border`:
    *   **Space:** Outlines do not take up space in the layout; they are drawn on top of the content around the element and do not affect the position or size of surrounding elements. Borders do take up space.
    *   **Shape:** Outlines are not necessarily rectangular; they can follow the shape of the element (e.g., for non-rectangular elements or with `border-radius`).
    *   **Sides:** You cannot set individual sides for an outline like you can for a border (e.g., no `outline-top`).
    Outlines are often used for focus indicators for accessibility.

30. **Q: How does `display: none;` differ from `visibility: hidden;`?**
    **A:**
    *   `display: none;`:
        *   Removes the element completely from the document flow.
        *   The element takes up no space on the page.
        *   It's as if the element doesn't exist.
        *   Child elements are also not displayed.
        *   Not accessible to screen readers.
    *   `visibility: hidden;`:
        *   Hides the element, but it still takes up its space in the layout.
        *   The element is invisible, but its allocated space is preserved.
        *   Child elements are also hidden, but if a child has `visibility: visible;`, it will be visible.
        *   Can be accessible to screen readers (depending on implementation).

**III. CSS Positioning (31-40)**

31. **Q: What are the different values for the `position` property?**
    **A:**
    *   `static` (default): The element is positioned according to the normal document flow. `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, and `z-index` properties have no effect.
    *   `relative`: The element is positioned according to the normal document flow, and then offset *relative to its normal position* using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`. The space it would have occupied in normal flow is preserved.
    *   `absolute`: The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for it. It is positioned relative to its *nearest positioned ancestor* (an ancestor with `position` other than `static`). If no positioned ancestor exists, it's positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the `<html>` element).
    *   `fixed`: The element is removed from the normal document flow. It is positioned relative to the *browser viewport*. It stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
    *   `sticky`: A hybrid of `relative` and `fixed`. The element is treated as `relative` until it scrolls to a specified offset (using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`), at which point it becomes "stuck" and behaves like `fixed` relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor or the viewport.

32. **Q: Explain `position: relative;`.**
    **A:** An element with `position: relative;` is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. Then, you can use `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to offset it from this normal position. The key is that the space originally allocated for the element in the normal flow is still preserved, and other elements are not affected by its offset. It also serves as a positioning context for absolutely positioned child elements.

33. **Q: Explain `position: absolute;`. What is its containing block?**
    **A:** An element with `position: absolute;` is removed from the normal document flow. Other elements will behave as if it's not there. Its position (using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`) is relative to its *nearest positioned ancestor*. A "positioned ancestor" is an ancestor element whose `position` value is anything other than `static` (i.e., `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`). If no such ancestor exists, it's positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport, or the `<html>` element).

34. **Q: Explain `position: fixed;`.**
    **A:** An element with `position: fixed;` is removed from the normal document flow. It is positioned relative to the browser viewport. This means it will stay in the same place on the screen even when the page is scrolled. `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` properties are used to position it.

35. **Q: Explain `position: sticky;`.**
    **A:** `position: sticky;` is a hybrid. The element is treated as `position: relative;` within its normal flow until it reaches a specified offset (defined by `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`) relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor (or the viewport if no scrolling ancestor). Once it hits that offset, it "sticks" in place and behaves somewhat like `position: fixed;` relative to that scrolling container.

36. **Q: What is the `z-index` property? How does it work?**
    **A:** The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of positioned elements (elements with `position` other than `static`). An element with a greater `z-index` value will appear in front of an element with a lower `z-index` value. `z-index` only works on positioned elements. Elements with the same `z-index` are stacked according to their order in the HTML.

37. **Q: What is a "stacking context"?**
    **A:** A stacking context is an HTML element that contains a set of layers. Within a local stacking context, the `z-index` values of its children are only meaningful relative to each other within that context. An element that creates a stacking context (e.g., a positioned element with a `z-index` other than `auto`, an element with `opacity < 1`, `transform`, `filter`) effectively "flattens" its children's stacking order relative to elements outside its context.

38. **Q: How can you center a block-level element horizontally?**
    **A:** For a block-level element with a defined `width`, you can center it horizontally by setting its `margin-left` and `margin-right` properties to `auto`.
    ```css
    .centered-block {
      width: 50%; /* Must have a defined width less than 100% */
      margin-left: auto;
      margin-right: auto;
      /* Shorthand: margin: 0 auto; (if top/bottom margin is 0) */
    }
    ```
    Flexbox and Grid also provide easy ways to center elements.

39. **Q: How can you center text horizontally within an element?**
    **A:** Using the `text-align: center;` property on the parent (block-level) element containing the text.
    ```css
    .text-container {
      text-align: center;
    }
    ```

40. **Q: What is the `float` property used for? What are its common issues?**
    **A:** The `float` property is used to take an element out of the normal flow and position it to the left (`float: left;`) or right (`float: right;`) of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it.
    Common Issues:
    *   **Container Collapse:** If a parent element contains only floated children (or its last child is floated), its height may collapse to zero because floated elements are removed from the normal flow.
    *   **Clearing Floats:** Sibling elements appearing after floated elements might wrap around them undesirably.
    While historically used for layouts, Flexbox and Grid are now preferred for most layout tasks. `float` is still useful for its original purpose: floating images within text.

**IV. CSS Layout: Flexbox & Grid (41-55)**

41. **Q: What is Flexbox? What problems does it solve?**
    **A:** Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout Module) is a one-dimensional layout model designed to provide a more efficient way to arrange, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.
    Problems it solves:
    *   Easily aligning items vertically and horizontally.
    *   Distributing space among items.
    *   Creating flexible and responsive layouts without relying on floats or complex positioning.
    *   Controlling the order of items.

42. **Q: What is the main axis and cross axis in Flexbox?**
    **A:**
    *   **Main Axis:** The primary axis along which flex items are laid out. It's defined by the `flex-direction` property (default is `row`, so main axis is horizontal).
    *   **Cross Axis:** The axis perpendicular to the main axis. If `flex-direction` is `row`, the cross axis is vertical.

43. **Q: What are some key properties for the flex container?**
    **A:**
    *   `display: flex;` or `display: inline-flex;` (to enable flex context)
    *   `flex-direction`: `row` (default), `row-reverse`, `column`, `column-reverse` (defines the main axis).
    *   `flex-wrap`: `nowrap` (default), `wrap`, `wrap-reverse` (controls if items wrap to multiple lines).
    *   `flex-flow`: Shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`.
    *   `justify-content`: Aligns items along the main axis (`flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`).
    *   `align-items`: Aligns items along the cross axis (`stretch` (default), `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`).
    *   `align-content`: Aligns lines of flex items when there's extra space in the cross-axis (only applies if `flex-wrap: wrap` and there are multiple lines) (`stretch`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`).

44. **Q: What are some key properties for flex items (children of a flex container)?**
    **A:**
    *   `order`: Controls the order in which items appear.
    *   `flex-grow`: Defines the ability of a flex item to grow if necessary (takes a unitless proportion).
    *   `flex-shrink`: Defines the ability of a flex item to shrink if necessary.
    *   `flex-basis`: Defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.
    *   `flex`: Shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`. (e.g., `flex: 1;` is `flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%;`)
    *   `align-self`: Allows overriding the `align-items` value for individual flex items.

45. **Q: How do you center an item both horizontally and vertically within a flex container?**
    **A:**
    ```css
    .flex-container {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center; /* Centers along the main axis (horizontal by default) */
      align-items: center;    /* Centers along the cross axis (vertical by default) */
      height: 300px; /* Container needs a defined height for vertical centering */
    }
    ```

46. **Q: What is CSS Grid Layout? How is it different from Flexbox?**
    **A:** CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you control the layout of items in rows and columns simultaneously.
    Differences from Flexbox:
    *   **Dimensionality:** Flexbox is primarily for one-dimensional layouts (either a row or a column at a time). Grid is for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns together).
    *   **Layout Approach:** Flexbox is content-out (items define how they fit). Grid is layout-in (container defines the grid structure, items are placed into it).
    *   **Use Cases:** Flexbox is great for components and smaller-scale layouts (like navigation bars, aligning items within a component). Grid is excellent for overall page layouts and complex two-dimensional arrangements.
    They can be used together effectively.

47. **Q: How do you define a grid container and grid items?**
    **A:**
    *   **Grid Container:** Apply `display: grid;` or `display: inline-grid;` to an element.
    *   **Grid Items:** Direct children of the grid container automatically become grid items.

48. **Q: What are `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties?**
    **A:** These properties define the columns and rows of the grid.
    *   `grid-template-columns`: Defines the number and size of columns.
    *   `grid-template-rows`: Defines the number and size of rows.
    Values can be fixed lengths (`px`, `em`), percentages, `auto`, or the `fr` unit (fractional unit representing a fraction of the available space).
    ```css
    .grid-container {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 100px; /* 3 columns: 1 fraction, 2 fractions, 100px */
      grid-template-rows: auto 50px;        /* 2 rows: auto height, 50px height */
    }
    ```

49. **Q: What is the `fr` unit in CSS Grid?**
    **A:** The `fr` unit represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container. For example, if `grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;`, the first column will take up 1/3 of the available space, and the second column will take up 2/3.

50. **Q: How can you place items in a CSS Grid? (Mention a few ways)**
    **A:**
    *   **Line-based placement:** Using `grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`, `grid-row-start`, `grid-row-end` (or shorthands `grid-column` and `grid-row`). Grid lines are numbered starting from 1.
        ```css
        .grid-item {
          grid-column-start: 1;
          grid-column-end: 3; /* Spans from line 1 to line 3 (i.e., 2 columns) */
          grid-row: 2 / 4;    /* Spans from row line 2 to row line 4 */
        }
        ```
    *   **Named grid areas:** Define named areas using `grid-template-areas` on the container, then assign items to these areas using `grid-area` on the item.
        ```css
        .grid-container {
          display: grid;
          grid-template-areas:
            "header header header"
            "sidebar main main"
            "footer footer footer";
        }
        .item-header { grid-area: header; }
        .item-sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; }
        ```
    *   **Auto-placement:** If not explicitly placed, items are automatically placed into the next available grid cell.

51. **Q: What is `grid-gap` (or `gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`)?**
    **A:** The `gap` property (and its longhands `row-gap` and `column-gap`) is used to define the size of the gutters (spaces) between grid rows and columns.
    ```css
    .grid-container {
      display: grid;
      gap: 10px; /* 10px gap between rows and columns */
      /* Or:
      row-gap: 15px;
      column-gap: 5px;
      */
    }
    ```
    The `gap` property also works for Flexbox containers (for gaps between flex items).

52. **Q: How can you create responsive grids?**
    **A:**
    *   Use relative units like `fr` and percentages for column/row sizes.
    *   Use `auto-fit` or `auto-fill` with `minmax()` in `grid-template-columns` to create columns that automatically adjust their number and size based on available space.
        ```css
        .grid-container {
          display: grid;
          grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
          gap: 1rem;
        }
        /* This creates columns that are at least 200px wide and expand to fill space.
           The number of columns adjusts to fit the container width. */
        ```
    *   Use media queries to change grid properties (e.g., `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-areas`) at different breakpoints.

53. **Q: What is `minmax()` function in CSS Grid?**
    **A:** `minmax(min, max)` is a function used in grid track sizing. It defines a size range, greater than or equal to `min` and less than or equal to `max`. This is very useful for creating responsive layouts where tracks can shrink or grow but not beyond certain limits.

54. **Q: Can Flexbox and Grid be used together?**
    **A:** Yes, absolutely. They are not mutually exclusive and often complement each other. A common pattern is to use Grid for the overall page layout (macro-layout) and Flexbox for aligning items within individual components or grid areas (micro-layout).

55. **Q: What is subgrid?**
    **A:** `subgrid` is a value for `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` that allows a nested grid item (which itself is a grid container) to align its tracks with its parent grid container's tracks. This helps in creating more consistent and complex alignments across nested grids. Support for `subgrid` has been improving in browsers.

**V. Responsive Web Design & Media Queries (56-65)**

56. **Q: What is Responsive Web Design (RWD)?**
    **A:** Responsive Web Design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes (desktops, tablets, phones). It aims to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience by adapting the layout and content.

57. **Q: What are the key techniques used in RWD?**
    **A:**
    *   **Fluid Grids:** Using relative units (like percentages or `fr`) for layout elements, allowing them to resize with the viewport.
    *   **Flexible Images/Media:** Ensuring images and media scale within their containing elements (e.g., `max-width: 100%;`).
    *   **Media Queries:** Applying different CSS rules based on device characteristics like viewport width, height, orientation, or resolution.
    *   **Mobile-First Approach (often recommended):** Designing for mobile devices first and then progressively enhancing the layout for larger screens.

58. **Q: What are media queries? How do you write one?**
    **A:** Media queries are a CSS3 feature that allows you to apply CSS styles only when certain conditions (media features) about the device or viewport are met.
    Syntax:
    ```css
    @media media-type and (media-feature: value) {
      /* CSS rules to apply when conditions are met */
      selector {
        property: value;
      }
    }
    ```
    Example:
    ```css
    /* Apply styles when viewport width is 600px or less */
    @media (max-width: 600px) {
      .sidebar {
        display: none;
      }
      .content {
        width: 100%;
      }
    }
    ```

59. **Q: What are common media features used in media queries?**
    **A:**
    *   `width`, `min-width`, `max-width` (of the viewport)
    *   `height`, `min-height`, `max-height` (of the viewport)
    *   `orientation` (`portrait` or `landscape`)
    *   `aspect-ratio`, `min-aspect-ratio`, `max-aspect-ratio`
    *   `resolution`, `min-resolution`, `max-resolution` (screen density)
    *   `prefers-color-scheme` (`light` or `dark`)
    *   `prefers-reduced-motion`

60. **Q: What is the "mobile-first" approach in RWD?**
    **A:** Mobile-first is a strategy where you design and develop for mobile devices (smallest screens) first, and then progressively enhance the design and layout for tablets and desktops using media queries (typically `min-width` based).
    Advantages:
    *   Focuses on core content and functionality for constrained environments.
    *   Often leads to better performance on mobile as default styles are simpler.
    *   Forces consideration of touch interactions and smaller screen constraints early on.

61. **Q: How do you make images responsive?**
    **A:**
    1.  **Basic Fluidity:** Set `max-width: 100%;` and `height: auto;` on the image. This ensures the image scales down to fit its container but doesn't scale up beyond its original size.
        ```css
        img {
          max-width: 100%;
          height: auto;
        }
        ```
    2.  **`<picture>` Element:** Provides art direction – serving different images based on media queries or different image formats.
        ```html
        <picture>
          <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_large.jpg">
          <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_medium.jpg">
          <img src="img_small.jpg" alt="Description">
        </picture>
        ```
    3.  **`srcset` and `sizes` Attributes on `<img>`:** For resolution switching (serving different sized images for different screen densities or viewport widths).
        ```html
        <img srcset="image-320w.jpg 320w,
                     image-480w.jpg 480w,
                     image-800w.jpg 800w"
             sizes="(max-width: 320px) 280px,
                    (max-width: 480px) 440px,
                    800px"
             src="image-800w.jpg" alt="Description">
        ```

62. **Q: What is the viewport meta tag and why is it important for RWD?**
    **A:** The viewport meta tag (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`) controls the size and scaling of the page's viewport on mobile devices.
    *   `width=device-width`: Sets the viewport width to the device's screen width.
    *   `initial-scale=1.0`: Sets the initial zoom level to 100%.
    Without it, mobile browsers often render pages at a default desktop width and then scale them down, making text tiny and requiring users to zoom. This tag is essential for proper responsive behavior.

63. **Q: Can you use media queries for print stylesheets?**
    **A:** Yes. You can use `@media print { ... }` to define styles that apply only when the page is printed. This allows you to hide unnecessary elements (like navigation), change fonts, colors, or layout for a better print experience.
    ```css
    @media print {
      body {
        font-family: serif;
        color: black;
      }
      .no-print { /* Class for elements to hide when printing */
        display: none;
      }
    }
    ```

64. **Q: What are breakpoints in responsive design?**
    **A:** Breakpoints are specific viewport widths at which your website's layout will change to adapt to different screen sizes. You define these in your media queries. For example, you might have breakpoints for small phones, larger phones, tablets, and desktops.

65. **Q: Besides viewport width, what other device characteristics can media queries target?**
    **A:** Viewport height, device width/height, orientation (portrait/landscape), aspect ratio, color depth, resolution (for high-DPI screens), and user preferences like `prefers-color-scheme` or `prefers-reduced-motion`.

---

**VI. CSS Specificity, Cascade & Inheritance (Revisited/Advanced) (66-70)**

66. **Q: If two CSS rules have the same specificity and target the same element, which one will apply?**
    **A:** The rule that appears later in the CSS source order will apply. This means if they are in the same stylesheet, the one defined further down wins. If they are in different stylesheets, the stylesheet linked later in the HTML document wins.

67. **Q: How does inline styling affect specificity?**
    **A:** Inline styles (using the `style` attribute directly on an HTML element) have the highest specificity, overriding any rules defined in external or internal stylesheets (unless an `!important` rule is used in those stylesheets).

68. **Q: Can you give an example of a highly specific selector and a less specific one?**
    **A:**
    *   **Highly Specific:** `body #main-content ul.nav-menu > li.active a[href^="https"] { ... }` (Uses ID, classes, attribute selector, child combinator)
    *   **Less Specific:** `p { ... }` (Simple element selector)

69. **Q: What is the purpose of the `:root` pseudo-class? How is it often used?**
    **A:** The `:root` pseudo-class represents the root element of the document. In HTML, this is always the `<html>` element. It has higher specificity than the `html` element selector.
    It's often used for:
    *   **Defining CSS Custom Properties (Variables):**
        ```css
        :root {
          --primary-color: blue;
          --base-font-size: 16px;
        }
        body {
          color: var(--primary-color);
          font-size: var(--base-font-size);
        }
        ```
    *   Setting global styles that need higher specificity than `html`.

70. **Q: How can you "reset" or "normalize" CSS styles? Why would you do this?**
    **A:**
    *   **CSS Reset:** A set of CSS rules that aims to remove or drastically reduce all default browser styling for HTML elements (e.g., setting margins, paddings to 0, standardizing font sizes). Examples: Eric Meyer's Reset CSS.
    *   **CSS Normalize:** Aims to make default browser styles consistent across browsers rather than removing them entirely. It preserves useful defaults while correcting bugs and inconsistencies. Example: Normalize.css.
    **Why do this?** Browsers have their own default stylesheets (user agent stylesheets) which can vary. Resetting or normalizing provides a more consistent baseline for styling across different browsers, reducing cross-browser inconsistencies and making it easier to apply your own custom styles predictably.

---

**VII. CSS Text & Font Properties (71-75)**

71. **Q: How do you change the font of text? What is a font stack?**
    **A:** Using the `font-family` property.
    A **font stack** is a list of font names provided as the value for `font-family`, separated by commas. The browser will try to use the first font in the list. If it's not available on the user's system, it tries the next one, and so on, until it finds an available font or falls back to a generic font family.
    ```css
    p {
      font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif; /* Font stack */
    }
    ```
    The last font in the stack should ideally be a generic font family (e.g., `serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`, `cursive`, `fantasy`).

72. **Q: What are web fonts? How do you use them (e.g., `@font-face`)?**
    **A:** Web fonts are fonts that are not pre-installed on a user's system but are downloaded by the browser along with other web assets. This allows designers to use a wider variety of fonts.
    Using `@font-face`:
    ```css
    @font-face {
      font-family: 'MyCustomFont'; /* Name you'll use in font-family property */
      src: url('mycustomfont.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Modern format */
           url('mycustomfont.woff') format('woff');   /* Older format */
      font-weight: normal;
      font-style: normal;
    }

    body {
      font-family: 'MyCustomFont', sans-serif;
    }
    ```
    You can also use services like Google Fonts, which provide the `@font-face` rules and host the font files.

73. **Q: What is the difference between `text-align` and `vertical-align`?**
    **A:**
    *   `text-align`: Applies to block-level containers and controls the horizontal alignment of their inline-level content (text, inline images, etc.). Values: `left`, `right`, `center`, `justify`.
    *   `vertical-align`: Applies to inline-level elements (like `<img>`, `<span>`, or table cells `<td>`, `<th>`) and controls their vertical alignment relative to the line box or the table cell's baseline. Common values: `baseline` (default), `top`, `middle`, `bottom`, `text-top`, `text-bottom`, length units, percentages. It does *not* vertically align block-level elements within their parent; Flexbox or Grid are used for that.

74. **Q: What does the `line-height` property control?**
    **A:** The `line-height` property specifies the height of a line box. It controls the amount of space above and below inline elements within a line (the leading). It can be set using unitless numbers (recommended, as it's a multiplier of the element's font-size), lengths (`px`, `em`), or percentages.

75. **Q: How can you create text shadows or box shadows?**
    **A:**
    *   **Text Shadow:** `text-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur-radius color;`
        ```css
        h1 {
          text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px gray;
        }
        ```
    *   **Box Shadow:** `box-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur-radius spread-radius color [inset];`
        ```css
        .my-box {
          box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
        }
        ```

**VIII. Colors, Backgrounds & Gradients (76-80)**

76. **Q: What are the different ways to specify colors in CSS?**
    **A:**
    *   **Keyword Names:** `red`, `blue`, `transparent`, `black`, etc.
    *   **Hexadecimal (HEX):** `#RRGGBB` (e.g., `#FF0000` for red) or `#RGB` shorthand (e.g., `#F00`). Can also include alpha: `#RRGGBBAA` or `#RGBA`.
    *   **RGB / RGBA:** `rgb(red, green, blue)` (values 0-255 or percentages) or `rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)` (alpha 0-1).
    *   **HSL / HSLA:** `hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)` (hue 0-360, sat/light 0-100%) or `hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)`. Often more intuitive for adjusting colors.
    *   `currentcolor` keyword: Represents the value of the element's `color` property.

77. **Q: What is the `opacity` property?**
    **A:** The `opacity` property specifies the transparency level of an element. A value of `1` is fully opaque (default), `0` is fully transparent (invisible), and values between 0 and 1 provide partial transparency. It affects the entire element, including its content and borders. If an element has `opacity < 1`, it creates a new stacking context.

78. **Q: How do you set a background image for an element? What are some related background properties?**
    **A:** Using the `background-image` property:
    ```css
    .hero {
      background-image: url('path/to/image.jpg');
    }
    ```
    Related background properties:
    *   `background-repeat`: `repeat` (default), `no-repeat`, `repeat-x`, `repeat-y`.
    *   `background-position`: `left top`, `center center`, `50% 50%`, `10px 20px`.
    *   `background-size`: `auto` (default), `cover` (scales to cover, may crop), `contain` (scales to fit, may leave empty space), specific dimensions (`100px 50px`).
    *   `background-attachment`: `scroll` (default, scrolls with content), `fixed` (fixed relative to viewport), `local` (scrolls with element's content).
    *   `background-color`: Sets a background color, often used as a fallback or behind a semi-transparent image.
    *   `background` (shorthand): `background: color image repeat attachment position / size;`

79. **Q: How do you create linear and radial gradients in CSS?**
    **A:**
    *   **Linear Gradient:** `linear-gradient(direction/angle, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);`
        ```css
        .linear {
          background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow);
          /* Or: background-image: linear-gradient(45deg, blue, green); */
        }
        ```
    *   **Radial Gradient:** `radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);`
        ```css
        .radial {
          background-image: radial-gradient(circle, white, lightblue);
          /* Or: background-image: radial-gradient(ellipse at top left, orange, red); */
        }
        ```
    Gradients are treated as images and used with `background-image`.

80. **Q: What is the difference between setting `background-color` and `color`?**
    **A:**
    *   `background-color`: Sets the background color of an element.
    *   `color`: Sets the color of the element's text content and text decorations.

---

**IX. CSS Transitions, Animations & Transforms (81-90)**

81. **Q: What are CSS Transitions? How do you create one?**
    **A:** CSS Transitions allow you to smoothly animate changes in CSS property values over a specified duration.
    To create one:
    1.  Specify the `transition-property` (which property to animate, e.g., `width`, `opacity`, `all`).
    2.  Specify the `transition-duration` (e.g., `0.5s`, `300ms`).
    3.  Optionally, specify `transition-timing-function` (`ease`, `linear`, `ease-in-out`, `cubic-bezier()`).
    4.  Optionally, specify `transition-delay`.
    The transition happens when the value of the specified property changes (e.g., on `:hover` or via JavaScript).
    Shorthand: `transition: property duration timing-function delay;`
    ```css
    .box {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: blue;
      transition: width 0.5s ease-in-out, background-color 1s linear;
    }
    .box:hover {
      width: 200px;
      background-color: red;
    }
    ```

82. **Q: What are CSS Animations? How do they differ from Transitions?**
    **A:** CSS Animations provide more complex, keyframe-based animations.
    Differences from Transitions:
    *   **Keyframes:** Animations use `@keyframes` to define multiple stages (from 0% to 100%) of an animation sequence, allowing for more intricate movements and property changes. Transitions are simpler, animating from a start state to an end state.
    *   **Control:** Animations offer more control, like `animation-iteration-count` (how many times to repeat), `animation-direction` (normal, reverse, alternate), `animation-fill-mode`, `animation-play-state`.
    *   **Trigger:** Transitions are typically triggered by a state change (e.g., hover). Animations can start automatically on page load or be controlled via JavaScript.

83. **Q: How do you define keyframes for a CSS Animation?**
    **A:** Using the `@keyframes` at-rule:
    ```css
    @keyframes slide-in {
      0% { /* or 'from' */
        transform: translateX(-100%);
        opacity: 0;
      }
      70% {
        transform: translateX(10px);
      }
      100% { /* or 'to' */
        transform: translateX(0);
        opacity: 1;
      }
    }

    .animated-element {
      animation-name: slide-in;
      animation-duration: 1s;
      animation-timing-function: ease-out;
      animation-fill-mode: forwards; /* Retains styles of the last keyframe */
    }
    ```

84. **Q: What are CSS Transforms? List a few common transform functions.**
    **A:** CSS Transforms allow you to modify the coordinate space of an element, visually changing its position, size, or shape without affecting the normal document flow (it doesn't cause reflow for surrounding elements).
    Common transform functions:
    *   `translate(x, y)` or `translateX(x)`, `translateY(y)`: Moves an element.
    *   `scale(x, y)` or `scaleX(x)`, `scaleY(y)`: Resizes an element.
    *   `rotate(angle)`: Rotates an element (e.g., `rotate(45deg)`).
    *   `skew(x-angle, y-angle)` or `skewX(angle)`, `skewY(angle)`: Skews an element.
    *   `matrix(...)`: Allows combining all 2D transforms.
    3D transforms also exist: `translate3d()`, `scale3d()`, `rotate3d()`, `perspective()`.

85. **Q: What is the difference between using `transform: translate()` and absolute positioning for moving an element?**
    **A:**
    *   **`transform: translate()`:**
        *   Moves the element visually without affecting the layout of other elements (doesn't cause reflow).
        *   Often more performant for animations because it can be GPU-accelerated.
        *   The element still occupies its original space in the document flow.
    *   **Absolute Positioning (with `top`/`left`):**
        *   Removes the element from the normal document flow.
        *   Changing `top`/`left` can cause reflows (recalculation of layout), which can be less performant for animations.
    For animations and visual adjustments where layout impact is not desired, `transform` is generally preferred.

86. **Q: What does `animation-fill-mode` property do?**
    **A:** The `animation-fill-mode` property specifies how an element is styled by an animation when it is not executing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).
    Common values:
    *   `none` (default): Animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing.
    *   `forwards`: The element will retain the style values from the last keyframe after the animation ends.
    *   `backwards`: The element will get the style values from the first keyframe as soon as the animation is applied (before it starts, if there's an `animation-delay`).
    *   `both`: Applies the rules for both `forwards` and `backwards`.

87. **Q: How can you pause and resume a CSS animation?**
    **A:** Using the `animation-play-state` property.
    *   `animation-play-state: running;` (default)
    *   `animation-play-state: paused;`
    This can be toggled via JavaScript or CSS (e.g., on `:hover`).

88. **Q: Which CSS properties are generally better for performance when animating?**
    **A:** Properties that can be handled by the browser's compositor thread and often GPU-accelerated are best for smooth animations. These typically include:
    *   `transform` (for `translate`, `scale`, `rotate`)
    *   `opacity`
    Animating properties like `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, `padding` can cause layout changes (reflows) and repaints, which are more expensive and can lead to janky animations.

89. **Q: What is the `will-change` property used for?**
    **A:** The `will-change` property is a hint to the browser about which properties of an element are expected to change frequently. This allows the browser to potentially optimize rendering for those changes in advance (e.g., by promoting the element to its own compositor layer).
    Example: `will-change: transform, opacity;`
    **Caution:** Overusing `will-change` can consume more resources and harm performance. Use it sparingly and only when you know an element will be animated and is experiencing performance issues. Remove it when the animation is done.

90. **Q: Can you trigger CSS transitions or animations with JavaScript?**
    **A:** Yes.
    *   **Transitions:** JavaScript can trigger transitions by adding/removing classes that define different states for the transitionable properties, or by directly changing CSS properties that are set to transition.
    *   **Animations:** JavaScript can add/remove classes that apply an animation, or directly manipulate `animation-name`, `animation-play-state`, etc. JavaScript can also listen for animation events (`animationstart`, `animationend`, `animationiteration`).

**X. CSS Preprocessors, Methodologies & Advanced Topics (91-100)**

91. **Q: What are CSS Preprocessors? Name a few popular ones.**
    **A:** CSS Preprocessors are scripting languages that extend the default capabilities of CSS. They are compiled into regular CSS that browsers can understand. They offer features like variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and inheritance.
    Popular ones:
    *   **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets):** Uses `.scss` (Sassy CSS, CSS-like syntax) or `.sass` (older, indented syntax).
    *   **Less (Leaner Style Sheets).**
    *   **Stylus.**

92. **Q: What are some benefits of using a CSS Preprocessor like Sass?**
    **A:**
    *   **Variables:** Store reusable values (colors, fonts, sizes).
    *   **Nesting:** Nest CSS rules within each other, mirroring HTML structure and improving readability.
    *   **Mixins:** Reusable blocks of CSS declarations (like functions).
    *   **Functions:** Manipulate values (e.g., darken a color).
    *   **Inheritance (`@extend`):** Share sets of CSS properties from one selector to another.
    *   **Partials and Imports (`@import`):** Break down CSS into smaller, manageable files.
    *   **Modularity and Organization:** Better code structure.
    *   **Loops and Conditionals:** Advanced logic for generating styles.

93. **Q: What are CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables)? How are they different from preprocessor variables?**
    **A:** CSS Custom Properties (often called CSS Variables) are entities defined by CSS authors that contain specific values to be reused throughout a document. They are set using a custom property notation (e.g., `--main-color: blue;`) and accessed using the `var()` function (e.g., `color: var(--main-color);`).
    Differences from preprocessor variables:
    *   **Browser Native:** CSS Custom Properties are native to the browser; they don't need compilation. Preprocessor variables are compiled away into static CSS values.
    *   **Dynamic:** CSS Custom Properties can be updated dynamically with JavaScript or within media queries, and these changes will cascade and affect elements using them. Preprocessor variables are static after compilation.
    *   **Scoping:** CSS Custom Properties follow standard CSS cascading and inheritance rules.

94. **Q: What is BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology? Why use it?**
    **A:** BEM is a naming convention for CSS classes that aims to create more modular, reusable, and understandable CSS.
    Structure:
    *   **Block:** A standalone entity that is meaningful on its own (e.g., `menu`, `button`, `form`). Class name: `.block`
    *   **Element:** A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block (e.g., `menu__item`, `button__icon`, `form__input`). Class name: `.block__element`
    *   **Modifier:** A flag on a block or element used to change its appearance, behavior, or state (e.g., `menu--theme-dark`, `button--disabled`, `form__input--error`). Class name: `.block--modifier` or `.block__element--modifier`
    **Why use it?**
    *   **Clarity & Readability:** Makes it clear what a class does and its relationship to other parts of the UI.
    *   **Modularity:** Encourages breaking UI into independent blocks.
    *   **Reduced Specificity Issues:** Relies on single class selectors, avoiding deep nesting and specificity conflicts.
    *   **Scalability:** Easier to maintain large CSS codebases.

95. **Q: What are some other CSS methodologies or architectural patterns besides BEM?**
    **A:**
    *   **OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS):** Focuses on separating structure from skin, and container from content, to create reusable CSS "objects."
    *   **SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS):** Divides styles into categories: Base, Layout, Module, State, and Theme rules.
    *   **ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS):** Organizes CSS files in a specific order based on specificity and explicitness, from generic to specific.
    *   **Atomic CSS / Functional CSS (e.g., Tailwind CSS):** Uses many small, single-purpose utility classes that are composed directly in the HTML (e.g., `.pt-4`, `.text-center`, `.bg-blue-500`).

96. **Q: What is "critical CSS"? Why is it important for performance?**
    **A:** Critical CSS refers to the minimal set of CSS required to render the "above-the-fold" content of a web page (the part visible without scrolling) as quickly as possible.
    **Importance for performance:**
    *   By inlining critical CSS directly in the `<head>` of the HTML document, the browser can start rendering the visible part of the page immediately, without waiting for external CSS files to download and parse.
    *   This improves perceived performance metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP).
    *   The rest of the CSS can then be loaded asynchronously or deferred.

97. **Q: What are CSS Modules? How do they help with styling?**
    **A:** CSS Modules are CSS files in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. When you import a CSS Module into a JavaScript module (e.g., in React or Vue), it exports an object mapping your original class names to uniquely generated global class names.
    **How they help:**
    *   **Local Scope:** Prevents class name collisions between different components or parts of an application.
    *   **Modularity:** Encourages writing styles that are tied to specific components.
    *   **Explicit Dependencies:** Makes it clear which styles a component uses.
    Example (React):
    ```css
    /* styles.module.css */
    .title { color: blue; }
    ```
    ```jsx
    // MyComponent.js
    import styles from './styles.module.css';
    function MyComponent() {
      return <h1 className={styles.title}>Hello CSS Modules</h1>;
    }
    // Renders <h1 class="styles_title__XyZ123">...</h1> (XyZ123 is a unique hash)
    ```

98. **Q: What is the `currentColor` keyword in CSS?**
    **A:** `currentColor` is a CSS keyword that represents the value of the `color` property of an element. It can be used as a value for any other property that accepts a color, such as `background-color`, `border-color`, or the `fill`/`stroke` of SVGs. This allows for creating themeable components where parts of the component inherit the text color.
    ```css
    .icon-container {
      color: blue; /* Text color */
      border: 1px solid currentColor; /* Border will be blue */
    }
    .icon-container svg {
      fill: currentColor; /* SVG fill will be blue */
    }
    ```

99. **Q: What are CSS Feature Queries (`@supports`)?**
    **A:** CSS Feature Queries (`@supports`) allow you to test if a browser supports a specific CSS property-value pair and apply styles conditionally based on that support. This is useful for progressive enhancement, allowing you to use modern CSS features for browsers that support them while providing fallbacks for older browsers.
    ```css
    @supports (display: grid) {
      /* Styles for browsers that support CSS Grid */
      .container {
        display: grid;
      }
    }

    @supports not (display: grid) {
      /* Fallback styles for browsers that don't support CSS Grid */
      .container {
        display: flex; /* Or use floats, etc. */
      }
    }
    ```

100. **Q: What is the difference between a "hard reset" and a "soft reset" (or normalize) in CSS?**
     **A:**
     *   **Hard Reset (e.g., Eric Meyer's Reset):** Aims to strip *all* default browser styling from HTML elements, setting things like margins, paddings, font sizes, list styles, etc., to a baseline (often zero or a common value). This gives the developer a "blank slate" to build upon, but requires them to redefine styles for almost every element.
     *   **Soft Reset / Normalize (e.g., Normalize.css):** Aims to make default browser styles *consistent* across different browsers rather than removing them entirely. It preserves useful defaults (like heading font sizes) and corrects common browser bugs and inconsistencies. It's generally considered a more modern and less aggressive approach than a hard reset.
